## How we do security


As much as possible, AutoGluon relies on automated tools to do security scanning. In particular, we support:

1. Dependency Analysis: Using Dependabot
2. Docker Scanning: Using Snyk
3. Code Analysis: Using CodeGuru


## Reporting a Vulnerability

Report any security vulnerabilities to `autogluon-security@amazon.com`. This email directly links to the Autogluon security maintenance team. Once the security vulnerability is confirmed, we will work privately on a patch, aiming to produce a dedicated bugfix release as swiftly as complexity allows.
