""" Runs autogluon.tabular on synthetic classification and regression datasets.
    We test various parameters to TabularPredictor() and fit()
    We then check the leaderboard:
       Did we run the expected list of models
       Did each model have the expected score (within given range)
       Did the ensembling produce the expected score (within given range)
    This helps us spot any change in model performance.
    If any changes are spotted, the script does its best to dump out new proposed score ranges
    that you can cut and paste into the tests.  Only do this once you've identified the cause!

    Potential naming confusion: 
        - this is a *regression* test, to make sure no functionality has accidentally got worse (testing terminology)
        - it runs two types of TabularPredictor tests : *regression* and classification (ML terminology)

    These tests are designed to run fast, to permit them to be run on a github hook.
    Currently the 11 tests, calling TabularPredictor.fit() 20 times, run in ~8 minutes on an 8 vcore machine with no GPU.

    Testing by @willsmithorg on master AG as of 2022-02-22 - 2022-02-23:
    Tested on AWS Linux instance m5.2xlarge, amzn2-ami-kernel-5.10-hvm-2.0.20211223.0-x86_64-gp2 with 
                                               (8  vcore, no GPU, Python==3.7.10, scikit-learn==1.0.2, torch==1.10.2), 
    Tested on Github jenkins Linux:
                                               (?  vcore,  0 GPU, Python==3.9.10, scikit-learn==1.0.2, torch==1.10.2), 
    Tested on AWS Windows instance t3.xlarge, 
                                               (4  vcore,  0 GPU, Python==3.9.7 , scikit-learn==1.0.2, torch==1.10.2), 
                                               - Pytorch scores are slightly different, all else same.
