        quantile between 0 and 100.

    Note that weighted_percentile(a, q) is not equivalent to

    sorted(a)[i] is assumed to be at quantile 0.0, while here we assume
    sorted(a)[i] is given a weight of 1.0 / len(a), hence it is at the

    """A decision tree regressor that provides quantile estimates.

    Parameters
    ----------
    criterion : string, optional (default="squared_error")
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "squared_error" for the mean squared error, which is equal to variance
        reduction as feature selection criterion, and "mae" for the mean
        absolute error.
        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion.

    splitter : string, optional (default="best")
        The strategy used to choose the split at each node. Supported
        strategies are "best" to choose the best split and "random" to choose
        the best random split.

    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default=None)
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:
        - If int, then consider `max_features` features at each split.
        - If float, then `max_features` is a percentage and
          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.
        - If "sqrt", then `max_features=sqrt(n_features)`.
        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.
        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.

    max_depth : int or None, optional (default=None)
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until
        all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than
        min_samples_split samples.

    min_samples_split : int, float, optional (default=2)
        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a percentage and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for percentages.

    min_samples_leaf : int, float, optional (default=1)
        The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a percentage and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for percentages.

    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Grow a tree with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.

    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.

    presort : bool, optional (default=False)
        Whether to presort the data to speed up the finding of best splits in
        fitting. For the default settings of a decision tree on large
        datasets, setting this to true may slow down the training process.
        When using either a smaller dataset or a restricted depth, this may
        speed up the training.

    Attributes
    ----------
    feature_importances_ : array of shape = [n_features]
        The feature importances.
        The higher, the more important the feature.
        The importance of a feature is computed as the
        (normalized) total reduction of the criterion brought
        by that feature. It is also known as the Gini importance [4]_.

    max_features_ : int,
        The inferred value of max_features.

    n_features_ : int
        The number of features when ``fit`` is performed.

    n_outputs_ : int
        The number of outputs when ``fit`` is performed.

    tree_ : Tree object
        The underlying Tree object.

    A random forest regressor that provides quantile estimates.
    A random forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of classifying
    decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and use averaging
    to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.
    The sub-sample size is always the same as the original

    Parameters
    ----------
    n_estimators : integer, optional (default=10)
        The number of trees in the forest.
    criterion : string, optional (default="squared_error")
        The function to measure the quality of a split. Supported criteria
        are "squared_error" for the mean squared error, which is equal to variance
        reduction as feature selection criterion, and "mae" for the mean
        absolute error.
        .. versionadded:: 0.18
           Mean Absolute Error (MAE) criterion.
    max_features : int, float, string or None, optional (default="auto")
        The number of features to consider when looking for the best split:

          `int(max_features * n_features)` features are considered at each
          split.
        - If "auto", then `max_features=n_features`.

        - If "log2", then `max_features=log2(n_features)`.
        - If None, then `max_features=n_features`.
        Note: the search for a split does not stop until at least one
        valid partition of the node samples is found, even if it requires to
        effectively inspect more than ``max_features`` features.
    max_depth : integer or None, optional (default=None)
        The maximum depth of the tree. If None, then nodes are expanded until

        The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node:
        - If int, then consider `min_samples_split` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_split` is a percentage and
          `ceil(min_samples_split * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each split.

        - If int, then consider `min_samples_leaf` as the minimum number.
        - If float, then `min_samples_leaf` is a percentage and
          `ceil(min_samples_leaf * n_samples)` are the minimum
          number of samples for each node.
        .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added float values for percentages.
    max_leaf_nodes : int or None, optional (default=None)
        Grow trees with ``max_leaf_nodes`` in best-first fashion.
        Best nodes are defined as relative reduction in impurity.
        If None then unlimited number of leaf nodes.
    bootstrap : boolean, optional (default=True)
        Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees.
    oob_score : bool, optional (default=False)

        If -1, then the number of jobs is set to the number of cores.
    random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, optional (default=None)
        If int, random_state is the seed used by the random number generator;
        If RandomState instance, random_state is the random number generator;
        If None, the random number generator is the RandomState instance used
        by `np.random`.
    verbose : int, optional (default=0)
        Controls the verbosity of the tree building process.
    warm_start : bool, optional (default=False)
        When set to ``True``, reuse the solution of the previous call to fit
        and add more estimators to the ensemble, otherwise, just fit a whole
        new forest.
    Attributes
    ----------
    estimators_ : list of DecisionTreeQuantileRegressor
        The collection of fitted sub-estimators.
    feature_importances_ : array of shape = [n_features]

        y_weights_[i, j] is the weight given to sample ``j` while
        estimator ``i`` is fit. If bootstrap is set to True, this
        reduces to a 2-D array of ones.
    y_train_leaves_ : array-like, shape=(n_estimators, n_samples)
        y_train_leaves_[i, j] provides the leaf node that y_train_[i]
