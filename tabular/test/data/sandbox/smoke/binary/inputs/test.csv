22781,15656894601,This is a nice toaster oven for its size and price. And it will bake the morning biscuits nicely. But I do not recommend Pizza in this oven. At least not the homemade variety. Maybe the store bought paper thin crust will cook up nicely. But I make my own from scratch and the crust does not cook all the way through. And when you leave it in long enough to cook all the way through it burns the cheese and everything else on top even on the lowest rack setting! Temperature settings seem to be accurate with a thermometer with nothing else in the oven. Although when putting in a small baking sheet with say 3 or 4 muffins the temperature drops between 10 and 15 degrees and will not come back up to say 350 degrees where it was in the beginning. I cannot imagine putting a casserole dish in this unit and having it bake properly.It is okay for reheating items that you do not want to put in the microwave. And the circulating fan at least in my unit is very noisy. And I am very hard of hearing.

54398,14609253461,"I only give 3-stars for the actual smell and effect of this oil. I will say this doesn't smell like any tea tree oil I've ever used. That's not necessarily a bad thing; maybe it's just the steam distillation process they use to extract the oil. I haven't noticed any bad reactions to this oil but I only use a handful of drops in my carrier oils to oil cleanse. I will say it doesn't burn like other pure tea tree oils I've used, which again, may be a testament to its quality. I don't use it as an acne spot treatment because I don't think it works very well for that. The price was very good, however, and since I don't noticed any adverse reactions, I continue to use it. A bottle this size lasts a really long time, which is always a plus. I do give it 5-stars for the packaging. It was so carefully, thoughtfully packaged (pics attached) I was pleasantly taken aback. I loved the two small bottles of Zen and Chi aroma blends, which I use in an oil diffuser in my bedroom for something a little different from all the holiday scents that have taken over elsewhere.

22179,16890516351,"I really would prefer to leave a 1 star review due to the inferno the product left on my face, but the formulation other than the fragrances used is actually quite nice, so I'm giving it 2. Brief background, I don't have sensitive skin, I'm not allergic to any of the components in the formula, and I have professional experience with aromatic materials. That being said...<br /><br />This product would be great if it were not for the fragrance isolates and essential oils used in it. I am very curious if Kate Somerville has adhered to IFRA guidelines in their formulation of this. The intense burning sensation caused by having the product on my face for less than a minute (I washed it off as quickly as possible) make me sincerely doubt that much attention was given to avoiding irritating fragrance levels in the formulation of the product. Really things like cinnamyl and cassia bark oil have no place in facial products and require such low concentrations that they can be difficult to work with. This product has a quite noticeable and strong cinnamon scent - more so than would be expected with appropriate levels. That coupled with the extreme burning sensation left by very short time on the skin makes me question the safety of the product. I would love to see the irritating fragrances and essential oils removed from the formula. They are especially inappropriate for use on facial skin. Fragrance issues aside, the feel on the skin after use (even as brief a time as I used it) is quite nice, and it seems to have wonderful exfoliating properties.<br /><br />Ultimately, I would not recommend the product to anyone though unless the concerns mentioned above are addressed. The ingredients that cause the burning sensation are known sensitizers, and it's just not worth the risk to the consumer to go ahead with the use of the product. I won't be using it again for sure.",5/16/2018 3:31,2,"Could be a nice product, but there are issues with fragrance components that seem to post a risk to the consumer..."

63983,13214302381,I bought my 2014 outback new. First car I bought new. I had a Mazda before this with 100000 miles on it and beat on it when I was younger. It never used oil. Never gave me a problem. The starter went once that was it. My outback on the other hand is burning oil. It started at 23000 miles on a vacation trip. Driving down the turnpike the low oil light came on. It was one full quart low 4000 miles after the last oil change. They say this is normal oil consumption. Now need to preform an oil consumption test. I thought i may have been a subaru customer for life. What a hassle so soon after buying my first one. Never again.,11/8/2017 2:21,1,Oil burner

18201,16907293801,"I got my device yesterday. I was pumped--a GPS watch that monitors heart rate for under $100? Score. I've been biking more recently, and I wanted something that allowed me to leave my phone home, but Garmin and TomTom watches are way too much for my beginner self. Plus, I don't care about phone notifications, or onboard apps, or whatever, I just wanted a tracker that tells time. I trust &quot;off-brand&quot; products typically, and this watch had what I wanted at a price point I can swallow.<br /><br />For the record, inside the box was the watch, a (useless) manual, and a usb charging cradle. It did not come with a wall outlet adapter, but it's the same 5 volt charger that any cell phone uses, so if you have this watch, you probably also have a cell phone, which means you will have a sufficient charging option.<br /><br />I attempted to set it up before I had to leave yesterday afternoon, but it didn't work immediately so I put it aside until I got back home last night. Then frustration ensued. I wasn't annoyed the first ten minutes. Sometimes devices take a bit longer to connect, whatever. The Bluetooth connection went off without a hitch. Then I started noticing a theme: I tried syncing so that I could &quot;un-brick&quot; the watch, the sync failed, the app attempted to auto-update the firmware, the update failed, the app crashed, I re-opened the app, the Bluetooth connected instantly, it tried syncing, the sync failed...you get it.<br /><br />I tried that for a solid twenty minutes (not because I'm insane; the firmware update said &quot;hold the device closer to the phone&quot; as if the failure were on my end, so I trusted that it was right and assumed I could just angle it slightly better--I was wrong). I power-cycled the phone. I would've done the same for the watch, but there's actually no power option while it's in &quot;screw you&quot; mode.<br /><br />Finally I gave up and looked online. There were some suggestions to download third-party apps that would aid in watch-phone communication. I watched videos in Chinese (I live in Wisconsin, about the farthest place from China in the country--I can count to ten and say thank you, but that's about it). Amazfit FAQ instructed me to go through 4 or 5 troubleshooting steps. I tried it all, to no avail.<br /><br />At that point, I was an hour into messing with this thing, and all I had to show for it was an error message (shown in the attached image). I was pissed, tired, and completely bewildered. I emailed tech support. To this point, about 10 hours later, they haven't responded. Until I hear back, this watch is unusable. I don't care what the cost was, or what the product feels like--if I can't use it, it gets a whopping 1-star rating.<br /><br />If they get back to me and fix it, I will update with the steps to fix and a new rating. If I don't update, it's because my issue was never resolved and I returned it.<br /><br />**UPDATE** They emailed back after a week and many apologies for the delay. After that, there was daily communication, I never felt neglected or forgotten. After I tried a couple more suggestions they gave, I asked about replacing the unit if this one is faulty. They had one final Hail Mary--could I try updating it on someone else's phone? I have an LG G4 from early 2016. My fiance has a Samsung Galaxy S8, so I tried updating it on hers and was successful. If you find a similar problem, give that a shot.<br /><br />I've been using it for a few days now that it works, so now I'll get into performance review:<br /><br />BATTERY<br />When I got the watch two weeks ago, the battery level was 86%. I've been using it for 4 days, and it sat idle previously. The battery is at 57% presently. That's constant heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, two GPS-tracked sessions of soccer kick-around (as &quot;Outdoor Running&quot;), and a rather intense bar-league volleyball game (tracked as &quot;Treadmill&quot; because it was indoors). I haven't yet tried it for cycling, which I initially purchased it for, but I'm certain it won't burn any more battery than outdoor running.<br /><br />Full disclosure, I have every notification turned off and I only sync to my phone daily, so I'm not killing the device with constant Bluetooth. That also means that I can't speak to the ability to send receive phone calls, texts, Facebooks, etc. I don't care, sorry.<br /><br />GPS<br />It works. It does take about 90 seconds for the watch to find GPS signal, but it never seemed to lose it. I pulled up the map of one of my soccer runs and it was a jumble of lefts and rights. I'm going to take it on a bike ride later along with my phone (tracking with Strava) to see if it tracks well enough to keep long-term.<br /><br />THINGS I DIDN'T THINK I'D CARE ABOUT, BUT ARE NOTICEABLE<br />-Multitasking -- I don't mean Pandora and Google at the same time. I mean a timer and literally anything else. Or tracking and anything else. If you're in one mode, you aren't able to leave the first mode without canceling it. E.g., I set the timer for 20 minutes, ran a bit, and wanted to see what my heart rate was. I had to cancel the timer to get out of it. Even a $10 Timex Ironman can switch screens like that. It isn't a deal breaker, but it is a bit annoying.<br /><br />-Alarms -- You have to set up an alarm on your phone and sync it to the watch, you can't just go into the alarm section on the watch and make a new alarm. Paired with the inability to multitask a timer, that could get frustrating down the road.<br /><br />- Compatibility -- Other Amazfit products are able to sync to Strava, but that's not yet in the cards for the Bip. I expect it will happen eventually, but currently there are two workaround options. They both involve 3rd party apps and a decent time commitment. One is a $2 &quot;Pro&quot; feature in a free app that syncs directly to Strava or Google Fit, etc (didn't try it); the other is absolutely free and8times more convoluted, requiring a second 3rd party app, exporting, and a manual upload on the Strava website (not a function on the app).<br /><br />-Mi Fit app -- In short, the app is below average. It's about as basic and stripped down as you can imagine. It's serviceable for sleep info and setting alarms and even looking at your run/ride, but some settings are in different areas than other settings, and it doesn't even offer as many settings as one of the 3rd party apps. It's not awful, just not intuitive.<br /><br />-Watch settings -- There really aren't many options for settings on the watch. It has some onboard watch faces and a brightness setting, and the long button press can strictly be used to as a shortcut to begin an activity. No double press, no other long press option.<br /><br />I'll post after a couple bike rides if I notice anything knocking about it.",6/15/2018 13:38,4,Better than expected
15726,16916629391,"I had a similar popper back in the 80's and it worked great. I forget the brand, and it disappeared years ago, so I thought I'd try getting a new one. These little poppers, sold under a variety of brands, are NOT the same thing. While they may look like my old popper, they are a far cry from performing the same.<br /><br />First, they are small. Like maybe half the volume of the one I remember. Not that big a deal in itself, but be prepared to only get a little bit of popcorn at a time. Compound this with the fact you can only do one batch every 10-20 minutes without overheating and you'll soon find that this isn't the popper to bring to a party.<br /><br />Next, the blower is too weak. If you just dump in kernels then turn it on, it has a hard time getting them spinning and will tend to burn some. The best way to do it is turn it on for a few seconds, then slowly dump the kernels in from the hole in the top. This will get them all spinning nicely. Unfortunately as soon as it starts to pop, several unpopped kernels will end up getting bounced out the top since it's so small. Once it really starts popping, the unpopped kernels tend to stay in place, but that's mainly because the silo gets clogged up with all the popped ones. There just isn't enough air volume in the blower to push them out the top so they just stack up in the silo. This is where things get tricky. You have to listen to when the kernels stop popping then immediately turn it off and dump the contents out by picking up and tipping the entire unit. If you don't time it right, the popped corn sitting in the silo will start to burn. Not what I would call convienient by any stretch.<br /><br />I remember the one I had in my younger days would blow every last popped corn all the way out the top, leaving not a single unpopped kernel in the bottom. It was actually kinda fun to watch the last couple ones spin around until they finally made it to the top and went shooting out, usually in some random direction. But rarely did unpopped kernels get spit out and I don't ever remember the silo clogging up.<br /><br />Ok, so whats the good? Well, it's cheap. It's small. It does pop popcorn. Sort of. If you're paying attention.<br /><br />I'm probably being generous with a 3 star rating, but if someone is looking for a way to occasionally pop enough corn for maybe one person and they don't mind a few unpopped kernels or jumping through a few hoops to get there, it does work. But surely there have to be better air poppers out there.",6/27/2018 22:39,3,Not your father's popper

994,17556792371,"I liked Sombra Warm Therapy once I finally received it. My first order turned out to be the Cold Therapy, even though I'd ordered the Warm. The company's customer service and communication were excellent, and they sent me a new jar, but that was the Cold also (same production lot). Again they communicated very quickly and helpfully, and they sent me a third jar, of a different production lot, and it was what I'd ordered. (Note: as of September 2018, Amazon does not allow returns of this item; hopefully that will change.)  What I now experience when I use the Warm Therapy is that it initially feels cold, but then it warms a bit - not like a heating pad or a microwavable wrap, but similar to indoor room temperature.  Outdoors on a summer day, it feels burning hot, so I don't apply Warm Therapy if I plan to be outside in the heat. This review may sound as if I'm not impressed with Sombra Warm Therapy, but here's the crucial part: it works. I apply it to sore muscles or joints, and even though it doesn't get particularly warm, the pain subsides. That's what I want, pain relief, regardless of what temperature the product seems to produce. Anything topical that fixes pain is a winner in my book, and many other products I've tried don't come close. So I recommend Sombra Warm Therapy, and I admire their commitment to customer service.",9/10/2018 16:57,4,"Not Very Warm, But It Fixes My Pain"

10399,16921242491,"My backyard is a field, and full of ticks. My dog uses the Frontline flea and tick drops, but at the beginning of tick season it's just not enough and I wanted a secondary protection system. She's all black and long haired, so even doing a tick check every day before bed isn't enough, because you can't see them. Wary of putting MORE chemicals on my dog, especially at once, I went to the internet to do some research. After reading reviews and seeing some disturbing photos of chemical burns from the traditional Seresto tick collar, I decided I'd try the natural route first to avoid exposing my dog to a collar that potentially could hurt her. I'm fairly impressed. It seems to do the job, and when I do find a tick in the house (far less frequently than I was finding them pre-collar), it's dried up and dead. The tightening slide seems to have a mind of its own and I do have to adjust it every couple of days, but at a fraction of the cost and without using burn-causing chemicals strapped to my dogs neck at all times, that's a very small draw back. I wish I could give a half star because this collar deserves four and a half - the annoying slide is the only thing that stops me from giving it a full five. I would totally recommend this collar to someone looking for a natural and less harmful way to keep their dog free of ticks.",7/3/2018 14:16,4,Great buy! Definitely recommend.
