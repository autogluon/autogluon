41196,15304417001,"It is bright but has some serious drawbacks.  I have been a lantern collector for many years.  One or two of my Colemans are 100 years old.  There are problems with this lantern that probably make it unsafe.<br /><br />First, the mantles.  It takes a surgeon's hands to put the $4 (each) on.  Be sure and turn the wire clips inward to avoid hitting the globe and destroying the mantle.  I could see weak spots in the mantles after burn in, and, sure enough, one blew after less than 30 minutes.  This happened several times.  I am used to $1 mantles lasting for several months, even after transport.  These pricey mantles will never last if you put them in a car after burn in.<br /><br />NEVER use the piezoelectric starter.  As propane accumulates in the globe, you will hear a &#34;foooomph&#34; when the propane ignites.  It burned the hair off the back of my hand and arm every time.  Instead, take the top off the lantern, use a long lighter, then crack the valve.  Lighting it this way creates much less drama.<br /><br />The lantern gets very hot!  The plastic on the piezoelectric starter melted after four uses.  You can see a broken mantle and melted starter in the picture. The burner tubes glow cherry red during use.  Being made out of pot metal and some brass, I do not think they will last very long.  The fuel valve gets too hot to comfortably touch.  I kept the heat shield in place, of course.<br /><br />This lantern is as bright as a Petromax and I like its looks.  That's about the best I can say.  I think this model will end up having a short production run, and some of the collecters may be able to tinker away some of the problems.  If you get one, be careful!  It can hurt you.<br /><br />A couple of days after I wrote the original review, the lantern developed a propane leak I just couln't fix.  I tried three different propane bottles.  I give up.  I'll be getting my money back on this one.  Maybe they were having a bad day in the Chinese factory it was made in.",2/3/2018 17:01,2,"Bright, but Not Ready for Prime Time",0

58744,16175264781,"Don't look into the lights - you'll thank me later.<br /><br />I would have rated this with 5 full stars but for one small problem. I ordered three of these for my garage, which has always been the pit of eternal darkness. No matter which lights I put in the garage's two ceiling sockets, nothing would light the garage more than a weak glow.<br /><br />I was excited when these arrived in the mail and let me tell you, they are fairly sexy. Each one is about the size of a smallish soup can and weighs just about the same but don't let the size fool you. They pack a punch! And that's what leads me to deduct a star from the rating. I opened the garage doors to let light in and turned off the overhead lights. After fumbling around in the cave-like darkness I was finally able to get the ladder positioned under each of the lights and swap them out. Little did I know that my life was going to change so dramatically.<br /><br />As the garage doors closed, I was overcome with giddiness at the thought of being able to see in my own garage. No longer would the darkness hide the terrors of my nightmares, I was finally to become the master of my own domain. Every object would be revealed to me in its true glory!<br /><br />With those warm thoughts floating through my head, I reached over and flipped the switch.<br /><br />And almost instantly began screaming in pain. Never, in my whole life had I ever imagined that anything in the universe could burn so incredibly bright. It was as if the searing light of a million suns had suddenly taken residence in my garage. For one brief instant I saw everything in my garage and came to a life changing revelation: I have a metric-ton of junk in my garage.<br /><br />That fleeting vision was the last I'll ever have. My retinas were fried within milliseconds and I can no longer see. Doctors tell me that it's permanent. In the name of all that is holy, I pray that's not the case. Otherwise, I'll be stuck reliving that vision of my garage forever more.<br /><br />If you need bright lights, these will do.",12/23/2017 22:48,4,Don't look into the lights - you'll thank me later ...,0

6930,15963545651,"I've been looking for a new hanging travel bag as a supplement or substitute for my large hanging bag that's better for long trips. Overall, this one left me saying, ""Meh.""<br /><br />Pros:<br />1. Good size for tiny travel bottles, shorter trips<br />2. Detachable pouch adds (some) versatility<br />3. Several pouches for organized traveling<br />4. Fabric repels water and seems securely sewn<br /><br />Cons:<br />1. It's a tight fit to close this when it's fully loaded with products<br />2. Pouches gape forward when it's hanging, not as shown in the photos. Anything taller or top-heavy is likely to fall out<br />3. Plastic hook. Seriously? All my other travel gear uses metal hooks, and I have zero worries about durability<br />4. Small hook size limits the range of places this can hang. Hotels are bad enough about providing decent hanging spots, and a small hook limits you even further<br />5. Detachable pouch is kind of pointless. It's far smaller than a standard ziploc baggie, so you'll be able to fit a lot less than normal. It's also only see-through on one side, and I've been burned by baggies that TSA can't see through completely (as in, delayed for ""further screening""). I don't think the designers ever actually carried anything through TSA.<br />6.

75815,13185841881,"UPDATE as of 11/6/2017: I wanted to provide an update on my review.  First of all, I was contacted by Aukey customer service out of the blue.  The rep reminded me that the lamp was backed by a 24 month warranty and offered me a replacement free of charge.  I admit that I was skeptical that a replacement lamp would be any different.  I wrongfully made the assumption that the lamp was designed to operate as a PRESS and HOLD lamp, but in reality I just had a defective product.  The replacement lamp worked right out of the box as TOUCH lamp (boy was I surprised!!!)<br /><br />The best thing about it is my experience with the customer service.  Aukey has definitely earned my business again!  What a great company to go out of their way to reach out to me and offer to address my issue!  NEVER in my experience as a consumer have I been treated with exceptional service!<br /><br />I've bumped my review from 3 stars to 4 stars.  I wish the lamp was a bit brighter, but it's a small lamp so you can't expect much.  Thank you again Aukey!<br /><br />-------------------------------------------------------------------------<br /><br />I normally don't write reviews, but I felt like I should after using this for several months now.  Overall, the lamp is OK.  I like the low profile sleek design and the brightness is what you would expect from a small lamp.  It doesn't fill up a room, but it does get bright enough as a bed side lamp.  I use this lamp for my kids' room as a bedtime story lamp.  I really like that it's an LED lamp for my kids so there's no risk of them burning themselves if they touch it.<br /><br />This is at best a 3 star lamp in my opinion.  The reason for that is primarily the touch sensor.  It's NOT RESPONSIVE at all.  I expected the lamp to toggle between the different modes by simply tapping it (an action that requires a split second and frankly effortlessly).  The touch sensor DOES NOT respond to a simple tap.  Instead, you HAVE to PRESS and HOLD for a good second and then RELEASE to trigger the touch action. To add to the frustration, it DOESN'T WORK about 50% of the time.  I would get really frustrated when I want to turn off the lamp, but it's not responding to my touch.  Instead of battling with the touch sensor, I would just resort to UNPLUGGING the lamp because it was more convenient.<br /><br />I've purchased other AUKEY products in the past, but this one is by far the poorest in quality.  How in the world did this even pass quality assurance/control?  I should've returned this and bought a different lamp, but my laziness is the reason why I still have this lamp.",9/20/2017 19:53,4,Great customer service!

I had purchased this item as a pre treatment to painting in order to help harden up what wood remained.<br /><br />I tested this on an inconspicuous area to see how and if it would work. So far some things to note<br /><br />1) Do NOT use any sort of styrofoam, or plastic around this material. I had poured a bit of this into a small disposable plastic cup and it eat right through the cup and burned into some nearby styrofoam.<br /><br />2) If you have any unsound paint, it will soak right through and cause the paint to peel. So if you were looking to only do a spot fix with some spot paint touch up afterwards, do NOT let this drip anywhere near any current paint.<br /><br />This is also extremely liquid.
