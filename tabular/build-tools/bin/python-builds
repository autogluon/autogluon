# This helper variable will contain the python interpreter type without the

# By default, this script will build for every version of Python enabled in your
# versionset.

# Uncomment any desired lines below, or add your own logic to filter any
# interpreters you don't want to build for.

# Filter a specific interpreter type:
# [[ $type == CPython ]] && exit 1
# [[ $type == Jython ]] && exit 1
# [[ $type == PyPy ]] && exit 1

# Filter everything except a specific interpreter type:
# [[ $type == CPython ]] || exit 1
# [[ $type == Jython ]] || exit 1
# [[ $type == PyPy ]] || exit 1

# Version requirements, test by string:
# [[ $version == 2* ]] || exit 1  # 2 only

# Comment out this line to allow your package to build for Python 2.7
# Read this first: https://pythonclock.org/
[[ $version == 3* ]] || exit 1  # 3 only

# Version requirements, test by number:
#   hint: numeric tests: -lt (<), -le (<=), -eq (==), -ge (>=), -gt (>)
# [[ $version -gt 35 ]] || exit 1  # > 35
# [[ $version -eq 27 || $version -ge 35 ]] || exit 1  # 27 or >=35
# [[ $version -gt 32 && $version -le 36 ]] || exit 1  # >32 and <=36

# Any interpreter not filtered by an above rule will be built for.
