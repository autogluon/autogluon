class TabularPredictor(BasePredictor):
    """ Object returned by `fit()` in Tabular Prediction tasks.
        Use for making predictions on new data and viewing information about models trained during `fit()`.

        Attributes
        ----------
        output_directory : str
            Path to directory where all models used by this Predictor are stored.
        problem_type : str
            What type of prediction problem this Predictor has been trained for.
        eval_metric : function or str
            What metric is used to evaluate predictive performance.
        label_column : str
            Name of table column that contains data from the variable to predict (often referred to as: labels, response variable, target variable, dependent variable, Y, etc).
        feature_types : dict
            Inferred data type of each predictive variable (i.e. column of training data table used to predict `label_column`).
        model_names : list
            List of model names trained during `fit()`.
        model_performance : dict
            Maps names of trained models to their predictive performance values attained on the validation dataset during `fit()`.
        class_labels : list
            For multiclass problems, this list contains the class labels in sorted order of `predict_proba()` output. Is = None for problems that are not multiclass.
            For example if `pred = predict_proba(x)`, then ith index of `pred` provides predicted probability that `x` belongs to class given by `class_labels[i]`.

                'model': The name of the model.
                'score_val': The validation score of the model on the 'eval_metric'.

                    'pred_time_test': The true end-to-end wall-clock inference time of the model for the dataset provided.
                        Equivalent to the sum of all 'pred_time_test_marginal' values for the model and all of its base models.
                    'pred_time_test_marginal': The inference time of the model for the dataset provided, minus the inference time for the model's base models, if it has any.
                        Note that this ignores the time required to load the model into memory when bagging is disabled.
                If str is passed, `dataset` will be loaded using the str value as the file path.
            only_pareto_frontier : bool (optional)
                If `True`, only return model information of models in the Pareto frontier of the accuracy/latency trade-off (models which achieve the highest score within their end-to-end inference time).
                At minimum this will include the model with the highest score and the model with the lowest inference time.
                This is useful when deciding which model to use during inference if inference time is a consideration.

        """
        Calculates feature importance scores for the given model.
        A feature's importance score represents the performance drop that results when the model makes predictions on a perturbed copy of the dataset where this feature's values have been randomly shuffled across rows.
        A feature score of 0.01 would indicate that the predictive performance dropped by 0.01 when the feature was randomly shuffled.
        The higher the score a feature has, the more important it is to the model's performance.
        If a feature has a negative score, this means that the feature is likely harmful to the final model, and a model trained with the feature removed would be expected to achieve a better predictive performance.
        Note that calculating feature importance can be a very computationally expensive process, particularly if the model uses hundreds or thousands of features. In many cases, this can take longer than the original model training.
        To estimate how long `feature_importance(model, dataset, features)` will take, it is roughly the time taken by `predict_proba(dataset, model)` multiplied by the number of features.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model : str, default = None
            Model to get feature importances for, if None the best model is chosen.
            Valid models are listed in this `predictor` by calling `predictor.model_names`
        dataset : str or :class:`TabularDataset` or `pandas.DataFrame` (optional)
            This Dataset must also contain the label-column with the same column-name as specified during fit().
            If specified, then the dataset is used to calculate the feature importance scores.
            If str is passed, `dataset` will be loaded using the str value as the file path.
            If not specified, the original dataset used during fit() will be used if `cache_data=True`. Otherwise, an exception will be raised.
            Do not pass the training data through this argument, as the feature importance scores calculated will be inaccurate.
        features : list, default = None
            List of str feature names that feature importances are calculated for and returned, specify None to get all feature importances.
            If you only want to compute feature importances for some of the features, you can pass their names in as a list of str.
        raw : bool, default = True
            Whether to compute feature importance on raw features in the original data (after automated feature engineering) or on the features used by the particular model.
            For example, a stacker model uses both the original features and the predictions of the lower-level models.
            Note that for bagged models, feature importance calculation is not yet supported when both `raw=True` and `dataset=None`. Doing so will raise an exception.
        subsample_size : int, default = 10000
            The number of rows to sample from `dataset` when computing feature importance.
            If `subsample_size=None` or `dataset` contains fewer than `subsample_size` rows, all rows will be used during computation.
            Larger values increase the accuracy of the feature importance scores.
            Runtime linearly scales with `subsample_size`.
        silent : bool, default = False
            Whether to suppress logging output

        Returns
        -------
        Pandas `pandas.Series` of feature importance scores.

    def refit_full(self, model='all'):
        """
        Retrain model on all of the data (training + validation).
        For bagged models:
            Optimizes a model's inference time by collapsing bagged ensembles into a single model fit on all of the training data.
            This process will typically result in a slight accuracy reduction and a large inference speedup.
            The inference speedup will generally be between 10-200x faster than the original bagged ensemble model.
                The inference speedup factor is equivalent to (k * n), where k is the number of folds (`num_bagging_folds`) and n is the number of finished repeats (`num_bagging_sets`) in the bagged ensemble.
            The runtime is generally 10% or less of the original fit runtime.
                The runtime can be roughly estimated as 1 / (k * n) of the original fit runtime, with k and n defined above.
        For non-bagged models:
            Optimizes a model's accuracy by retraining on 100% of the data without using a validation set.
            Will typically result in a slight accuracy increase and no change to inference time.
            The runtime will be approximately equal to the original fit runtime.
        This process does not alter the original models, but instead adds additional models.
        If stacker models are refit by this process, they will use the refit_full versions of the ancestor models during inference.
        Models produced by this process will not have validation scores, as they use all of the data for training.
            Therefore, it is up to the user to determine if the models are of sufficient quality by including test data in `predictor.leaderboard(dataset=test_data)`.
            If the user does not have additional test data, they should reference the original model's score for an estimate of the performance of the refit_full model.
                Warning: Be aware that utilizing refit_full models without separately verifying on test data means that the model is untested, and has no guarantee of being consistent with the original model.
        `cache_data` must have been set to `True` during the original training to enable this functionality.

        Parameters
        ----------
        model : str, default = 'all'
            Model name of model to refit.
                If 'all' then all models are refitted.
                If 'best' then the model with the highest validation score is refit.
            All ancestor models will also be refit in the case that the selected model is a weighted or stacker ensemble.
            Valid models are listed in this `predictor` by calling `predictor.model_names`.
