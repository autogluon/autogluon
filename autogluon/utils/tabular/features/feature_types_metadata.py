class FeatureTypesMetadata:
    """
    Contains feature type metadata information such as type family groups (feature_types_raw) and special feature type groups (feature_types_special)

    feature_types_raw is the dictionary computed as output to :function:`autogluon.utils.tabular.features.utils.get_type_family_groups_df`
    feature_types_special is an optional dictionary to communicate special properties of features to downstream models that have special handling functionality for those feature types.
        As an example, feature_types_special might contain a key 'text_ngram' indicating that the list of values are all features which were generated from a nlp vectorizer and represent ngrams.
        A downstream model such as a K-Nearest-Neighbor model could then check if 'text_ngram' is present in feature_types_special and drop those features if present, to speed up training and inference time.
