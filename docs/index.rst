AutoGluon: AutoML for Text, Image, and Tabular Data
====================================================

`AutoGluon` enables easy-to-use and easy-to-extend AutoML with a focus on automated stack ensembling, deep learning, and real-world applications spanning text, image, and tabular data. Intended for both ML beginners and experts, `AutoGluon` enables you to:

- Quickly prototype deep learning and classical ML solutions for your raw data with a few lines of code.
- Automatically utilize state-of-the-art techniques (where appropriate) without expert knowledge.
- Leverage automatic hyperparameter tuning, model selection/ensembling, architecture search, and data processing.
- Easily improve/tune your bespoke models and data pipelines, or customize `AutoGluon` for your use-case.

.. note::

   Example using AutoGluon to train and deploy high-performance model on a tabular dataset:
   
   >>> from autogluon.tabular import TabularPrediction as task
   >>> predictor = task.fit(train_data=task.Dataset(file_path=TRAIN_DATA.csv), label=COLUMN_NAME)
   >>> predictions = predictor.predict(task.Dataset(file_path=TEST_DATA.csv))
   
   AutoGluon can be applied just as easily for prediction tasks with image or text data.
