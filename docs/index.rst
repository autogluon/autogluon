AutoGluon: AutoML Toolkit for Deep Learning
===========================================

`AutoGluon` enables easy-to-use and easy-to-extend AutoML with a focus on deep learning and real-world applications spanning image, text, or tabular data. Intended for both ML beginners and experts, `AutoGluon` enables you to:

- Quickly prototype deep learning solutions for your data with few lines of code.
- Leverage automatic hyperparameter tuning, model selection / architecture search, and data processing.
- Automatically utilize state-of-the-art deep learning techniques without expert knowledge.
- Easily improve existing bespoke models and data pipelines, or customize `AutoGluon` for your use-case.

.. note::

   Example using AutoGluon to train and deploy high-performance model on a tabular dataset:
   
   >>> from autogluon import TabularPrediction as task
   >>> predictor = task.fit(train_data=task.Dataset(file_path=TRAIN_DATA.csv), label_column=COLUMN_NAME)
   >>> predictions = predictor.predict(task.Dataset(file_path=TEST_DATA.csv))
   
   AutoGluon can be applied just as easily for prediction tasks with image or text data.
