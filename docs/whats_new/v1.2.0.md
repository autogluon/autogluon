# Version 1.2.0

We're happy to announce the AutoGluon 1.2.0 release.

## Spotlight

## General

## Tabular

### Highlights

### New Features
- Parallel model fit support. @LennartPurucker @Innixma (#4606)

### Fixes and Improvements

## TimeSeries

### Highlights
AutoGluon now features Chronos-Bolt⚡ — new, more accurate, and up to 250x faster Chronos models that can also run on CPU. The new release also adds fine-tuning and covariate handling support for all Chronos models ([tutorial](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-chronos.html)). These additions as well as new presets result in significantly improved forecast accuracy — AutoGluon v1.2 achieves a 70%+ win rate against the previous release.
