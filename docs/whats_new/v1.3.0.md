## TimeSeries

The new v1.3 release brings numerous usability improvements and bug fixes to the TimeSeries module.
Internally, we completed a major refactor of the core classes and introduced static type checking to simplify future contributions, accelerate development, and catch potential bugs earlier.


### API Changes and Deprecations
* As part of the refactor, we made several changes to the internal `AbstractTimeSeriesModel` class. If you maintain a **custom model** implementation, you will likely need to update it. Please refer to the [custom forecasting model tutorial](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/timeseries/advanced/forecasting-custom-model.html) for details.

    No action is needed from the users that rely solely on the public API of the `timeseries` module (`TimeSeriesPredictor` and `TimeSeriesDataFrame`).


### New Features
* New tutorial on adding custom forecasting models by @shchur in [#4749](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/pull/4749)
* Add `cutoff` support in `evaluate` and `leaderboard` by @abdulfatir in [#5078](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/pull/5078)
* Add `horizon_weight` support for `TimeSeriesPredictor` by @shchur in [#5084](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/pull/5084)
* Add `make_future_data_frame` method to TimeSeriesPredictor by @shchur in [#5051](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/pull/5051)
* Refactor ensemble base class and add new ensembles by @canerturkmen in [#5062](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/pull/5062)

### Code Quality
