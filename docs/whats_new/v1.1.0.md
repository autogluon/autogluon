### Chronos, a pretrained model for time series forecasting

AutoGluon-TimeSeries now features [Chronos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07815), a family of forecasting models pretrained on large collections of open-source time series datasets that can generate accurate zero-shot predictions for new unseen data. Check out the [new tutorial](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/timeseries/forecasting-chronos.html) to learn how to use Chronos through the familiar `TimeSeriesPredictor` API.

## TimeSeries

### Highlights
AutoGluon 1.1 comes with numerous new features and improvements to the time series module. These include highly requested functionality such as feature importance,
support for categorical covariates, ability to visualize forecasts, and enhancements to logging.
The new release also comes with considerable improvements to forecast accuracy, achieving 60% win rate and 3% average error reduction compared to the previous AutoGluon version. These improvements are mostly attributed to the addition of Chronos, improved preprocessing logic, and native handling of missing values.

## AutoMM

### Highlights

AutoMM 1.1 introduces the innovative Conv-LoRA, 
a parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) method stemming from our latest paper presented at ICLR 2024, 
titled "[Convolution Meets LoRA: Parameter Efficient Finetuning for Segment Anything Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17868)". 
Conv-LoRA is designed for fine-tuning the Segment Anything Model, 
exhibiting superior performance compared to previous PEFT approaches, 
such as LoRA and visual prompt tuning, 
across various semantic segmentation tasks in diverse domains 
including natural images, agriculture, remote sensing, and healthcare. Check out [our Conv-LoRA example](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/tree/master/examples/automm/Conv-LoRA).

### New Features

- Added Conv-LoRA, a new parameter efficient fine-tuning method. @Harry-zzh @zhiqiangdon (#3933, #3999, #4007, #4022, #4025)
- Added support for new column type: 'image_base64_str'. @Harry-zzh @zhiqiangdon (#3867)

## Tabular

### Highlights
AutoGluon-Tabular 1.1 primarily focuses on bug fixes and stability improvements. In particular, we have greatly improved the runtime performance for large datasets between 5 - 30 GB in size through the usage of subsampling for decision threshold calibration and the weighted ensemble fitting to 1 million rows, maintaining the same quality while being far faster to execute. We also adjusted the default weighted ensemble iterations from 100 to 25, which will speedup all weighted ensemble fit times by 4x. We heavily refactored the `fit_pseudolabel` logic, and it should now achieve noticeably stronger results.

### Fixes and Improvements
- Fix return value in `predictor.fit_weighted_ensemble(refit_full=True)`. @Innixma (#1956)
- Enhance performance on large datasets through subsampling. @Innixma (#3977)
- Fix refit_full crash when out of memory. @Innixma (#3977)
- Refactor and enhance `.fit_pseudolabel` logic. @Innixma (#3930)
- Fix crash in memory check during HPO for LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost. @Innixma (#3931)
- Fix dynamic stacking on windows. @Innixma (#3893)
- LightGBM version upgrade. @mglowacki100, @Innixma (#3427)
- Fix memory-safe sub-fits being skipped if Ray is not initialized. @LennartPurucker (#3868)
- Logging improvements. @AnirudhDagar (#3873)
- Hide deprecated methods. @Innixma (#3795)
- Documentation improvements. @Innixma @AnirudhDagar (#2024, #3975, #3976, #3996)
