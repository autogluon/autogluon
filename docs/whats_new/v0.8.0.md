## Changes

### Highlights
* AutoGluon TimeSeries introduced several major improvements, including new models, upgraded presets that lead to better forecast accuracy, and optimizations that speed up training & inference.
* AutoGluon Tabular now supports **[calibrating the decision threshold in binary classification](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/tabular/tabular-indepth.html#decision-threshold-calibration)** ([API](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/api/autogluon.tabular.TabularPredictor.calibrate_decision_threshold.html)), leading to massive improvements in metrics such as `f1` and `balanced_accuracy`. It is not uncommon to see `f1` scores improve from `0.70` to `0.73` as an example. We **strongly** encourage all users who are using these metrics to try out the new decision threshold calibration logic.
* AutoGluon MultiModal introduces two new features: 1) **PDF document classification**, and 2) **Open Vocabulary Object Detection**.
* AutoGluon MultiModal upgraded the presets for object detection, now offering `medium_quality`, `high_quality`, and `best_quality` options. The empirical results demonstrate significant ~20% relative improvements in the mAP (mean Average Precision) metric, using the same preset.
* AutoGluon Tabular has added an experimental **Zeroshot HPO config** which performs well on small datasets <10000 rows when at least an hour of training time is provided (~60% win-rate vs `best_quality`). To try it out, specify `presets="experimental_zeroshot_hpo_hybrid"` when calling `fit()`.
* AutoGluon EDA added support for **Anomaly Detection** and **Partial Dependence Plots**.
* AutoGluon Tabular has added experimental support for **[TabPFN](https://github.com/automl/TabPFN)**, a pre-trained tabular transformer model. Try it out via `pip install autogluon.tabular[all,tabpfn]` (hyperparameter key is "TABPFN")!

### TimeSeries
In v0.8 we introduce several major improvements to the Time Series module, including new models, upgraded presets that lead to better forecast accuracy, and optimizations that speed up training & inference.

#### Highlights
- New models: `PatchTST` and `DLinear` from GluonTS, and `RecursiveTabular` based on integration with the [`mlforecast`](https://github.com/Nixtla/mlforecast) library @shchur (#3177, #3184, #3230)
- Improved accuracy and reduced overall training time thanks to updated presets @shchur (#3281, #3120)
- 3-6x faster training and inference for `AutoARIMA`, `AutoETS`, `Theta`, `DirectTabular`, `WeightedEnsemble` models @shchur (#3062, #3214, #3252)

#### New Features
- Dramatically faster repeated calls to `predict()`, `leaderboard()` and `evaluate()` thanks to prediction caching @shchur (#3237)
- Reduce overfitting by using multiple validation windows with the `num_val_windows` argument to `fit()` @shchur (#3080)
- Exclude certain models from presets with the `excluded_model_types` argument to `fit()` @shchur (#3231)
- New method `refit_full()` that refits models on combined train and validation data @shchur (#3157)
- Train multiple configurations of the same model by providing lists in the `hyperparameters` argument @shchur (#3183)
- Time limit set by `time_limit` is now respected by all models @shchur (#3214)

#### Enhancements
- Improvements to the `DirectTabular` model (previously called `AutoGluonTabular`): faster featurization, trained as a quantile regression model if `eval_metric` is set to `"mean_wQuantileLoss"` @shchur (#2973, #3211)
- Use correct seasonal period when computing the MASE metric @shchur (#2970)
- Check the AutoGluon version when loading `TimeSeriesPredictor` from disk @shchur (#3233)

#### Minor Improvements / Documentation / Bug Fixes
* Update documentation and tutorials @shchur (#2960, #2964, #3296, #3297)
* General bug fixes and improvements @shchur (#2977, #3058, #3066, #3160, #3193, #3202, #3236, #3255, #3275, #3290)

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) tools
In 0.8 we introduce a few new tools to help with data exploration and feature engineering:
* **Anomaly Detection** @gradientsky (#3124, #3137) - helps to identify unusual patterns or behaviors in data that deviate significantly from the norm.  It's best used when finding outliers, rare events, or suspicious activities that could indicate fraud, defects, or system failures. Check the [Anomaly Detection Tutorial](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/eda/eda-auto-anomaly-detection.html) to explore the functionality.
* **Partial Dependence Plots** @gradientsky (#3071, #3079) -  visualize the relationship between a feature and the model's output for each individual instance in the dataset. Two-way variant can visualize potential interactions between any two features. Please see this tutorial for more detail: [Using Interaction Charts To Learn Information About the Data](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/eda/eda-auto-analyze-interaction.html#using-interaction-charts-to-learn-information-about-the-data)
#### Bug Fixes / Code and Doc Improvements
* Switch regression analysis in `quick_fit` to use residuals plot @gradientsky (#3039)
* Added `explain_rows` method to `autogluon.eda.auto` - Kernel SHAP visualization @gradientsky (#3014)
* General improvements and fixes @gradientsky (#2991, #3056, #3102, #3107, #3138)
