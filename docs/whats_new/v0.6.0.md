# Version 0.6.0

We're happy to announce the AutoGluon 0.6 release. 0.6 contains major enhancements to Tabular, Multimodal, and Time Series
modules, along with many quality of life improvements and fixes.

As always, only load previously trained models using the same version of AutoGluon that they were originally trained on.
Loading models trained in different versions of AutoGluon is not supported.

This release contains [**230** commits from **25** contributors](https://github.com/awslabs/autogluon/graphs/contributors?from=2022-07-18&to=2022-11-15&type=c)!

# Changes

## AutoMM

### New features

### More tutorials and examples

## Tabular

### New features

- New experimental model `FT_TRANSFORMER`. You can access it via specifying the `FT_TRANSFORMER` key
in the `hyperparameters` dictionary or via `presets="experimental_best_quality"`. 
It is recommended to use GPU to train this model.
If given enough time, this generally improves the ensemble quality.
@bingzhaozhu, @innixma (#2085, #2379, #2389, #2410)
- New experimental model compilation support via `predictor.compile_models()`. 
Currently only Random Forest and Extra Trees have compilation support.
You will need to install extra dependencies for this to work: `pip install autogluon.tabular[all,skl2onnx]`.
Compiling models dramatically speeds up inference time (~10x) when processing small batches of samples (<10000).
@liangfu, @innixma (#2225, #2260, #2300)
- Added `predictor.clone(...)` method to allow perfectly cloning a predictor object to a new directory. 
This is useful to preserve the state of a predictor prior to altering it
(such as prior to calling `.save_space`, `.distill` or `.refit_full`. @innixma (#2071)
- Added simplified `num_gpus` and `num_cpus` arguments to `predictor.fit` to control total resources.
@yinweisu, @innixma (#2263)
- Improved stability and effectiveness of HPO functionality via various refactors regarding our usage of ray.
@yinweisu, @innixma (#1974, #1990, #2094, #2121, #2133, #2195, #2253, #2263, #2330)
- Upgraded dependency versions: XGBoost 1.7, CatBoost 1.1, Scikit-learn 1.1, Pandas 1.5, Scipy 1.9, Numpy 1.23.
@innixma (#2373)
- Added python version compatibility check when loading a fitted TabularPredictor.
Will now error if python versions are incompatible. @innixma (#2054)
- Added `fit_weighted_ensemble` argument to `predictor.fit`. This allows the user to disable the weighted ensemble.
@innixma (#2145)

### Other Enhancements
- Improved logging clarity when using `infer_limit`. @innixma (#2014)
- Significantly improved HPO search space of XGBoost. @innixma (#2123)
- Fixed HPO crashing when tuning Random Forest, Extra Trees, or KNN. @innixma (#2070)
- Optimized roc_auc metric scoring speed by 7x. @innixma (#2318, #2331)
- Fixed bug with AutoMM Tabular model crashing if not trained last. @innixma (#2309)
- Refactored `Scorer` classes to be easier to use, plus added comprehensive unit tests for all metrics. @innixma (#2242)
- Sped up TextSpecial feature generation during preprocessing by 20% @gidler (#2095)
- imodels integration improvements @Jalagarto (#2062)
- Fix crash when calling feature importance in quantile_regression. @leloykun (#1977)
- Add FAQ section for missing value imputation. @innixma (#2076)
- Various minor fixes and cleanup @innixma, @yinweisu (#1997, #2031, #2124, #2144, #2178, #2340, #2342, #2345, #2374)

## Time Series

### New features

- `TimeSeriesPredictor` now supports **static features** (a.k.a. time series metadata, static covariates) and **
  time-varying covariates** (a.k.a. dynamic features or related time series). @shchur @canerturkmen (#1986, #2238,
  #2276, #2287)
- AutoGluon-TimeSeries now uses **PyTorch** by default (for `DeepAR` and `SimpleFeedForward`), removing the dependency
  on MXNet. @canerturkmen (#2074, #2205, #2279)
- New models! `AutoGluonTabular` relies on XGBoost, LightGBM and CatBoost under the hood via the `autogluon.tabular`
  module. `Naive` and `SeasonalNaive` forecasters are simple methods that provide strong baselines with no increase in
  training time. `TemporalFusionTransformerMXNet` brings the TFT transformer architecture to AutoGluon. @shchur (#2106,
  #2188, #2258, #2266)
- Up to 20x faster parallel and memory-efficient training for statistical (local) forecasting models like `ETS`, `ARIMA`
  and `Theta`, as well as `WeightedEnsemble`. @shchur @canerturkmen (#2001, #2033, #2040, #2067, #2072, #2073, #2180,
  #2293, #2305)
- Up to 3x faster training for GluonTS models with data caching. GPU training enabled by default on PyTorch models.
  @shchur (#2323)
- More accurate validation for time series models with multi-window backtesting. @shchur (#2013, #2038)
- `TimeSeriesPredictor` now handles irregularly sampled time series with `ignore_index`. @canerturkmen, @shchur (#1993,
  #2322)
- Improved and extended presets for more accurate forecasting. @shchur (#2304)
- 15x faster and more robust forecast evaluation with updates to `TimeSeriesEvaluator` @shchur (#2147, #2150)
- Enabled Ray Tune backend for hyperparameter optimization of time series models. @shchur (#2167, #2203)
