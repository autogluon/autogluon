# Version 0.7.0

We're happy to announce the AutoGluon 0.7 release. This release contains a new experimental module `autogluon.eda` for exploratory
data analysis. AutoGluon 0.7 offers **conda-forge support**, enhancements to Tabular, MultiModal, and Time Series
modules, and many quality of life improvements and fixes.

As always, only load previously trained models using the same version of AutoGluon that they were originally trained on.
Loading models trained in different versions of AutoGluon is not supported.

This release contains [**170** commits from **19** contributors](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/graphs/contributors?from=2023-01-10&to=2023-02-16&type=c)!

### NEW: `autogluon.eda` (Exploratory Data Analysis)

We are happy to announce AutoGluon Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) toolkit. Starting with v0.7, AutoGluon now can analyze and visualize different aspects of data and models. We invite you to explore the following tutorials: [Quick Fit](https://auto.gluon.ai/0.7.0/tutorials/eda/eda-auto-quick-fit.html), [Dataset Overview](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/eda/eda-auto-dataset-overview.html), [Target Variable Analysis](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/eda/eda-auto-target-analysis.html), [Covariate Shift Analysis](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/eda/eda-auto-covariate-shift.html). Other materials can be found in [EDA Section](https://auto.gluon.ai/stable/tutorials/eda/index.html) of the website.

### General

- Added Python 3.10 support. @Innixma (#2721)

- Removed `dask` and `distributed` dependencies. @Innixma (#2691)
- Removed `autogluon.text` and `autogluon.vision` modules. We recommend using `autogluon.multimodal` for text and vision tasks going forward.

### AutoMM

AutoGluon MultiModal (a.k.a AutoMM) supports three new features: 1) document classification; 2) named entity recognition
for Chinese language; 3) few shot learning with SVM  

Meanwhile, we removed `autogluon.text` and `autogluon.vision` as these features are supported in `autogluon.multimodal`

#### New features

* `autogluon.text` namespace is deprecated. @sxjscience @Innixma (#2695, #2847)

### Tabular

1) TabularPredictor’s inference speed has been heavily optimized, with an average **250% speedup** for real-time inference. This means that TabularPredictor can satisfy <10 ms end-to-end latency on many datasets when using `infer_limit`, and the `high_quality` preset can satisfy <100 ms end-to-end latency on many datasets by default.
2) TabularPredictor’s `"multimodal"` hyperparameter preset now leverages the full capabilities of MultiModalPredictor, resulting in stronger performance on datasets containing a mix of tabular, image, and text features.

#### Performance Improvements

- Upgraded versions of all dependency packages to use the latest releases. @Innixma (#2823, #2829, #2834, #2887, #2915)
- Accelerated ensemble inference speed by 150% by removing TorchThreadManager context switching. @liangfu (#2472)
- Accelerated FastAI neural network inference speed by 100x+ and training speed by 10x on datasets with many features. @Innixma (#2909)
- (From 0.6.1) Avoid unnecessary DataFrame copies to accelerate feature preprocessing by 25%. @liangfu (#2532)
- (From 0.6.1) Refactor `NN_TORCH` model to be dataset iterable, leading to a 100% inference speedup. @liangfu (#2395)
- MultiModalPredictor is now used as a member of the ensemble when `TabularPredictor.fit` is passed `hyperparameters="multimodal"`. @Innixma (#2890)

#### API Enhancements

- Added `predict_multi` and `predict_proba_multi` methods to `TabularPredictor` to efficiently get predictions from multiple models. @Innixma (#2727)
- Allow label column to not be present in `leaderboard` calls when scoring is disabled. @Innixma (#2912)

#### Deprecations

- Added a deprecation warning when calling `predict_proba` with `problem_type="regression"`. This will raise an exception in a future release. @Innixma (#2684)

#### Bug Fixes / Doc Improvements

- Fixed incorrect time_limit estimation in `NN_TORCH` model. @Innixma (#2909)
- Fixed error when fitting with only text features. @Innixma (#2705)
- Fixed error when `calibrate=True, use_bag_holdout=True` in `TabularPredictor.fit`. @Innixma (#2715)

## autogluon.timeseries

### New features

- New models from [StatsForecast](https://github.com/Nixtla/statsforecast) got introduced in `TimeSeriesPredictor` for various presets (`medium_quality`, `high_quality` and `best_quality`). @shchur (#2758)
- Support missing value imputation for TimeSeriesDataFrame which allows users to customize filling logics for missing values and fill gaps in an irregular sampled times series. @shchur (#2781)
- Improve quantile forecasting performance of the AutoGluon-Tabular forecaster using the empirical noise distribution. @shchur (#2740)

### Bug Fixes / Doc Improvements
