## Spotlight: Tabular Performance Enhancements

AutoGluon 1.0 features **major enhancements to predictive quality**, establishing a new state-of-the-art in Tabular modeling.
To the best of our knowledge, **AutoGluon 1.0 marks the largest leap forward in the state-of-the-art for tabular data since the [original AutoGluon paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.06505) from March 2020**.
The enhancements come primarily from two features:
Dynamic stacking to [mitigate stacked overfitting](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/issues/2779#issuecomment-1736468165),
and a new learned model hyperparameters portfolio via Zeroshot-HPO, obtained from the newly released [TabRepo](https://github.com/autogluon/tabrepo) ensemble simulation library.
Together, they lead to a **75% win-rate compared to AutoGluon 0.8 with faster inference speed, lower disk usage, and higher stability.**

### AutoML Benchmark Results

OpenML released the [official 2023 AutoML Benchmark results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12560) on November 16th, 2023.
Their results show AutoGluon 0.8 as the state-of-the-art in AutoML systems across a wide variety of tasks:
"Overall, in terms of model performance, AutoGluon consistently has the highest average rank in our benchmark."
We now showcase that AutoGluon 1.0 achieves far superior results even to AutoGluon 0.8!

Below is a comparison on the [OpenML AutoML Benchmark](https://openml.github.io/automlbenchmark/index.html) across 1040 tasks.
LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost results were obtained via AutoGluon, and other methods are from [the official AutoML Benchmark 2023 results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12560).
AutoGluon 1.0 has a 95%+ win-rate against traditional tabular models, including **a 99% win-rate vs LightGBM and a 100% win-rate vs XGBoost**.
AutoGluon 1.0 has between an 82% and 94% win-rate against other AutoML systems.
For all methods, AutoGluon is able to achieve >10% average loss improvement (Ex: Going from 90% accuracy to 91% accuracy is a 10% loss improvement).
**AutoGluon 1.0 achieves first place in 63% of tasks**, with lightautoml having the second most at 12% (AutoGluon 0.8 previously took first place 48% of the time).
AutoGluon 1.0 even achieves a 7.4% average loss improvement over AutoGluon 0.8!

Not only is AutoGluon more accurate in 1.0,
it is also more stable thanks to our [new usage of Ray subprocesses](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/pull/3614) during low-memory training,
resulting in **0 task failures** on the AutoML Benchmark.

AutoGluon 1.0 is capable of achieving the fastest inference throughput of any AutoML system while still obtaining state-of-the-art results.
By specifying the `infer_limit` fit argument, users can trade off between accuracy and inference speed to meet their needs.

As seen in the below plot, AutoGluon 1.0 sets the Pareto Frontier for quality and inference throughput, achieving Pareto Dominance compared to all other AutoML systems.
AutoGluon 1.0 High achieves superior performance to AutoGluon 0.8 Best with 8x faster inference and 8x less disk usage!

You can get more details on the results [here](https://github.com/Innixma/autogluon-benchmark/tree/master/v1_results).

We would like to conclude this spotlight by thanking Pieter Gijsbers, SÃ©bastien Poirier, Erin LeDell, Joaquin Vanschoren,
and the rest of the AutoML Benchmark authors for their key role in 
providing a shared and extensive benchmark to monitor the progress of the AutoML field.
Their support has been invaluable to the AutoGluon project's continued growth.

We would also like to thank Frank Hutter, who continues to be a leader within the AutoML field, for organizing
the AutoML Conference in 2022 and 2023 to bring the community together to share ideas and align on a compelling vision.

We are excited to see what our users can accomplish with AutoGluon 1.0's enhanced performance.
As always, we will continue to improve AutoGluon in future releases to push the boundaries of AutoML forward for all.

## Spotlight: Newly Published Papers

### AutoGluon-TimeSeries: AutoML for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting

We have published a [paper on AutoGluon-TimeSeries](https://openreview.net/forum?id=XHIY3cQ8Tew) at AutoML Conference 2023 ([YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niLmfjXeHnE)).
In the paper, we benchmarked AutoGluon and popular open-source forecasting frameworks (including DeepAR, TFT, AutoARIMA, AutoETS, AutoPyTorch).
AutoGluon produces SOTA results in point and probabilistic forecasting, and even **achieves 65% win rate against the best-in-hindsight combination of models**.

### TabRepo: A Large Scale Repository of Tabular Model Evaluations and its AutoML Applications

We have published a paper on Tabular Zeroshot-HPO ensembling simulation to arXiv ([Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.02971.pdf), [GitHub](https://github.com/autogluon/tabrepo)).
This paper is key to achieving the performance improvements seen in AutoGluon 1.0, and we plan to continue to develop the code-base to support future enhancements.

### XTab: Cross-table Pretraining for Tabular Transformers

We have published a paper on tabular Transformer pre-training at ICML 2023 ([Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.06090), [GitHub](https://github.com/BingzhaoZhu/XTab)).
In the paper we demonstrate state-of-the-art performance for tabular deep learning models, including being able to match the performance of XGBoost and LightGBM models.
While the pre-trained transformer is not yet incorporated into AutoGluon, we plan to integrate it in a future release.

### Learning Multimodal Data Augmentation in Feature Space

Our paper on learning multimodal data augmentation was accepted at ICLR 2023 ([Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.14453.pdf), [GitHub](https://github.com/lzcemma/LeMDA/)).
This paper introduces a plug-and-play module to learn multimodal data augmentation in feature space, 
 with no constraints on the identities of the modalities or the relationship between modalities.
We show that it can (1) improve the performance of multimodal deep learning architectures, 
(2) apply to combinations of modalities that have not been previously considered, 
and (3) achieve state-of-the-art results on a wide range of applications comprised of image, text,
and tabular data. This work is not yet incorporated into AutoGluon, but we plan to integrate it in a future release.

### Data Augmentation for Object Detection via Controllable Diffusion Models

Our paper on generative object detection data augmentation has been accepted at WACV 2024 (Paper and Github link will be available soon). 
This paper proposes a data augmentation pipeline based on controllable diffusion models and CLIP, 
with visual prior generation to guide the generation and post-filtering by category-calibrated CLIP scores to control its quality.
We demonstrate that the performance improves across various tasks and settings when using our augmentation pipeline with different detectors. 
Although diffusion models are currently not integrated into AutoGluon, we plan to incorporate the data augmentation techniques in a future release.

### Adapting Image Foundation Models for Video Understanding

We have published a paper on how to efficiently adapt image foundation models for video understanding at ICLR 2023 ([Paper Link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.03024.pdf), [GitHub](https://github.com/taoyang1122/adapt-image-models)). This paper introduces spatial adaptation, temporal adaptation and joint adaptation to gradually equip a frozen image model with spatiotemporal reasoning capability. The proposed method achieves competitive or even better performance than traditional full finetuning while largely saving the training cost of large foundation models.

* Deprecated the `AutoMMPredictor` in favor of `MultiModalPredictor` @zhiqiangdon (#3650)
* `autogluon.multimodal.MultiModalPredictor`
  * Deprecated the `config` argument in the fit API. @zhiqiangdon (#3679)
  * Deprecated the `init_scratch` and `pipeline` arguments in the init API @zhiqiangdon (#3668)

### TimeSeries
* `autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor`
  * Deprecated argument `TimeSeriesPredictor(ignore_time_index: bool)`. Now, if the data contains irregular timestamps, either convert it to regular frequency with `data = data.convert_frequency(freq)` or provide frequency when creating the predictor as `TimeSeriesPredictor(freq=freq)`.
  * `predictor.evaluate()` now returns a dictionary (previously returned a float)
  * `predictor.score()` -> `predictor.evaluate()`
  * `predictor.get_model_names()` -> `predictor.model_names()`
  * `predictor.get_model_best()` -> `predictor.model_best`
  * Metric `"mean_wQuantileLoss"` has been renamed to `"WQL"`
  * `predictor.leaderboard()` `silent` argument deprecated, replaced by `display`, defaults to False
  * When setting `hyperparameters` to a string in `predictor.fit()`, supported values are now `"default"`, `"light"` and `"very_light"`
* `autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesDataFrame`
  - `df.to_regular_index()` -> `df.convert_frequency()`
  - Deprecated method `df.get_reindexed_view()`. Please see deprecation notes for `ignore_time_index` under `TimeSeriesPredictor` above for information on how to deal with irregular timestamps
- Models
  - All models based on MXNet (`DeepARMXNet`, `MQCNNMXNet`, `MQRNNMXNet`, `SimpleFeedForwardMXNet`, `TemporalFusionTransformerMXNet`, `TransformerMXNet`) have been removed 
  - Statistical models from Statmodels (`ARIMA`, `Theta`, `ETS`) have been replaced by their counterparts from StatsForecast (#3513). Note that these models now have different hyperparameter names.
  - `DirectTabular` is now implemented using `mlforecast` backend (same as `RecursiveTabular`), most hyperparameter names for the model have changed.
- `autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesEvaluator` has been deprecated. Please use metrics available in `autogluon.timeseries.metrics` instead.
- `autogluon.timeseries.splitter.MultiWindowSplitter` and `autogluon.timeseries.splitter.LastWindowSplitter` have been deprecated. Please use `num_val_windows` and `val_step_size` arguments to `TimeSeriesPredictor.fit` instead (alternatively, use `autogluon.timeseries.splitter.ExpandingWindowSplitter`).
