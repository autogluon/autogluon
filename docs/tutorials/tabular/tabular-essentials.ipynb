AutoGluon can also automatically handle common issues like missing data and rescaling feature values.\n",

    "We did not specify separate validation data and so AutoGluon automatically choses a random training/validation split of the data. The data used for validation is separated from the training data and is used to determine the models and hyperparameter-values that produce the best results. Rather than just a single model, AutoGluon trains multiple models and ensembles them together to ensure superior predictive performance.\n",

    "AutoGluon automates this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGluon automatically and iteratively tests values for hyperparameters to produce the best performance on the validation data. This involves repeatedly training models under different hyperparameter settings and evaluating their performance. This process can be computationally-intensive, so `fit()` can parallelize this process across multiple threads (and machines if distributed resources are available). To control runtimes, you can specify various arguments in `fit()` as demonstrated in the subsequent **In-Depth** tutorial.\n",
