Rather than just a single model, AutoGluon trains multiple models and ensembles them together to obtain superior predictive performance.\n",

    "By default, AutoGluon tries to fit [various types of models](../../api/autogluon.tabular.models.rst) including neural networks and tree ensembles. Each type of model has various hyperparameters, which traditionally, the user would have to specify. AutoGluon automates this process.\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGluon automatically and iteratively tests values for hyperparameters to produce the best performance on the validation data. This involves repeatedly training models under different hyperparameter settings and evaluating their performance. This process can be computationally-intensive, so `fit()` parallelizes this process across multiple threads using [Ray](https://www.ray.io/). To control runtimes, you can specify various arguments in `fit()` such as `time_limit` as demonstrated in the subsequent **[In-Depth Tutorial](tabular-indepth.ipynb)**."

We recommend you only use `hyperparameter_tune_kwargs` if your goal is to deploy a single model rather than an ensemble.\n",

To specify a particular evaluation metric other than the default, set the `eval_metric` parameter of [TabularPredictor()](../../api/autogluon.tabular.TabularPredictor.rst) and AutoGluon will tailor its models to optimize your metric (e.g. `eval_metric = 'mean_absolute_error'`). For evaluation metrics where higher values are worse (like RMSE), AutoGluon will flip their sign and print them as negative values during training (as it internally assumes higher values are better). You can even specify a custom metric by following the [Custom Metric Tutorial](advanced/tabular-custom-metric.ipynb)."
