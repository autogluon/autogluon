# Image Classification - Advanced
:label:`sec_imgadvanced`

While the :ref:`sec_imgquick` introduced basic usage of AutoGluon `fit`, `evaluate`, `predict` with default configurations, this tutorial dives into the various options that you can specify for more advanced control over the fitting process.

These options include: defining the search space of various hyperparameter values regarding to the training of neural networks, specifying how to actually search through this hyperparameter space, and how to schedule each particular job which actually train a network under a particular hyperparameter configuration.
The advanced functionalities of AutoGluon allow you to leverage your external knowledge about your particular prediction problem and computing resources to guide the training process. If properly utilized, you may be able to achieve superior performance within less training time.


We again begin by letting AutoGluon know that `ImageClassification` is the task of interest: 

```{.python .input}
from autogluon import ImageClassification as task

import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
```

## Create AutoGluon Dataset

Let's first create the dataset using the same subset of the `Shopee-IET` dataset as before.
Recall that as we only specify the `train_path`, a 90/10 train/validation split is automatically performed.

```{.python .input}
dataset = task.Dataset(name='shopeeiet', train_path='~/data/train')
```

## Understanding default configurations of AutoGluon's fit

To ensure this demo runs quickly, we expect each call to `fit` can be finished within minutes,
and individual training runs (also referred to as `trials`) each last for 10 epochs.

```{.python .input}
time_limits = 1*60
epochs = 2
```

We first again use the default arguments of the `fit` function to train the neural networks:

```{.python .input}
results = task.fit(dataset,
                   time_limits=time_limits,
                   epochs=epochs)
```

The validation and test top-1 accuracy are:

```{.python .input}
print('Top-1 val acc: %.3f' % results.reward)
test_dataset = task.Dataset(name='shopeeiet', test_path='~/data/test')
test_acc = task.evaluate(test_dataset)
print('Top-1 test acc: %.3f' % test_acc)
```

Let's now dive deeper into the default settings of `fit` that an advanced user may wish to alter.

Recall that rather than training image classification models from scratch, AutoGluon by default first loads networks that has already been pretrained on another image dataset and then continues training the networks on your provided dataset (after appropriately modifying the output layer for the current task). Let's inspect which pretrained neural network candidates are by default for image classification tasks:

```{.python .input}
print('Default models:')
print(results.metadata['net'])
```

We can also look up the default optimizers used by `fit` to train each neural network (ie. to update the weight parameters based on mini-batches of training data):
 
```{.python .input}
print('Default optimizers:')
print(results.metadata['optimizer'])
```

Beyond which pretrained model and which optimizer to use, deep learning in general involves tons of other design choices, which we collectively refer to as `hyperparameters`. Given possible values of the hyperparameters to try out, we require a smart strategy to efficiently find those hyperparameter values which will produce the best classifier. Strategies might include techniques such as grid/random search, Hyperband, Bayesian optimization, etc. In AutoGluon, which hyperparameter search strategy to use is specified by a `Searcher` object.
When the Searcher returns a particular hyperparameter configuration to try out, we must train the neural network under the specified configuration settings, a process referred to as a `trial`. In parallel/distributed settings, we may wish to run multiple trials simultaneously in order to try out more hyperparameter configurations in less time. In AutoGluon, how trials are orchestrated is controlled by a `Scheduler` object.
The default search_strategy used in `fit` for image classification is:

```{.python .input}
print('Default search_strategy:')
print(results.metadata['search_strategy'])
```

When we have already trained many networks under many hyperparameter configurations and see that a current trial is performing very good that satisfies our need in comparison, it may be wise to infer this is the time to simply terminate the trial right away. This way, the final model could be used right away and we don't need to wait until the full fitting procedure completed.  

We can retrieve AutoGluon's default stop criterion and resources used for each trial using:

```{.python .input}
print('Stop criterion:')
print(results.metadata['stop_criterion'])

print('Resources used for each trial:')
print(results.metadata['resources_per_trial'])
```

In general, we can expect fairly strong predictive performance using the default configurations in `fit`, if given enough computing resources and runtime.
In order to achieve superior performance with limited computation, we can manually specify different configurations in `fit` based on prior knowledge or research papers.
One important aspect of this involves defining the space of hyperparameter values to search over.
We will use `autogluon.Nets` and `autogluon.Optimizers` as
examples to show how to specify a custom hyperparameter search space, and ensure it is used by the `fit` function.



## Specify which pretrained networks to try

We start with specifying the pretrained neural network candidates.
In AutoGluon, the network candidates are represented as [autogluon.Nets](../api/autogluon.network.html),
which is simply a list of networks.  
Given such a list, AutoGluon will try training different networks from this list to identify the best-performing candidate.
This is an example of a `categorical` search space, in which there are a limited number of values to choose from.

For more information regarding categorical search spaces, please
refer to the [search space API](../api/autogluon.space.html).

In addition to the default network candidates, let's also add `resnet50` to the search space:

```{.python .input}
import autogluon as ag
net_list = ['resnet18_v1',
            'resnet34_v1',
            'resnet50_v1']

# default net list for image classification would be overwritten
# if net_list is provided
nets = ag.Nets(net_list)

print(nets)
```

Let's then call `fit` using these manually-specified network candidates, and evaluate on validation and test data.

```{.python .input}
results = task.fit(dataset,
                   nets,
                   time_limits=time_limits,
                   epochs=epochs)
```

The validation and test top-1 accuracy are:

```{.python .input}
print('Top-1 val acc: %.3f' % results.reward)
test_acc = task.evaluate(test_dataset)
print('Top-1 test acc: %.3f' % test_acc)
```

## Specify which optimizers to try

Similarly, we can manually specify which of optimizer candidates to try, in order to further improve the results.
In AutoGluon, [autogluon.Optimizers](../api/autogluon.optimizer.html) 
defines a list of optimization search_strategys, from which we can construct another search space to identify which optimizer works best for our task (as well as what are the best hyperparameter configurations for this optimizer).

Like `autogluon.Nets`, the choice of which optimizer to use again corresponds to a [categorical](../api/autogluon.space.html#autogluon.space.List) search space:

```{.python .input}
optimizers_default = ag.Optimizers(['sgd', 'adam'])
```

Additionally, we can customize the optimizer-specific hyperparameters as another search space.
As an example for both `Adam` and `SGD`, we can configure the learning rate and weight decay in a continuous-valued search space.
Below, we specify that this space should be searched on a log-linear scale, providing two numbers to be lower and upper bounds for the space of values to try.  

Additionally, the momentum in `SGD` is configured as another continuous search space on a linear scale, where the two numbers are also the lower and upper bounds of the space. Moreover, to achieve better results, we could also configure the learning rate scheduler as a categorical space, where in this example, we enable decay and cosine based learning rate schedulers for SGD optimizer.


```{.python .input}
sgd_opt = ag.optimizer.SGD(learning_rate=ag.LogLinear(1e-4, 1e-1),
                           momentum=ag.Linear(0.85, 0.95),
                           wd=ag.LogLinear(1e-6, 1e-2))
adam_opt = ag.optimizer.Adam(learning_rate=ag.LogLinear(1e-4, 1e-1),
                             wd=ag.LogLinear(1e-6, 1e-2))
optimizers = ag.Optimizers([sgd_opt, adam_opt])

print(optimizers)
```

Please refer to [log search space](../api/autogluon.space.html#autogluon.space.Log) and [linear search space](../api/autogluon.space.html#autogluon.space.Linear) for more details.

Besides, we could also specify the candidates of learning rate schedulers which are typically leveraged to achieve better results.
We then put the new network and optimizer search space and the learning rate schedulers together in the call to `fit` and might expect better results if we have made smart choices:

```{.python .input}
results = task.fit(dataset,
                   nets,
                   optimizer=optimizers,
                   lr_scheduler=ag.List('poly', 'cosine'),
                   time_limits=time_limits,
                   epochs=epochs)
```

The validation and test top-1 accuracy are:

```{.python .input}
print('Top-1 val acc: %.3f' % results.reward)
test_acc = task.evaluate(test_dataset)
print('Top-1 test acc: %.3f' % test_acc)
```

## Specify a hyperparameter search strategy and how to schedule trials

[autogluon.searcher](../api/autogluon.searcher.html)
will support both basic and advanced search search_strategys for both hyperparameter optimization and architecture search. Advanced search search_strategys, such as Population-Based Training, and BOHB, are coming soon.  
We currently support Hyperband, random search and Bayesian Optimization. Although these are simple techniques, they can be surprisingly powerful when parallelized, which can be easily enabled in AutoGluon.
The easiest way to specify random search is via the string name:

In AutoGluon, [autogluon.scheduler](../api/autogluon.scheduler.html) orchestrates how individual training jobs are scheduled.

AutoGluon currently supports scheduling trials in serial order and with early stopping (eg. if the performance of the model early within training already looks bad, the trial may be terminated early to free up resources).
We support a serial [FIFO scheduler](../api/autogluon.scheduler.html#autogluon.scheduler.FIFO_Scheduler)
and an early stopping scheduler: [Hyperband](../api/autogluon.scheduler.html#autogluon.scheduler.Hyperband_Scheduler).
Which scheduler to use is easily specified via the string name:

```{.python .input}
search_strategy = 'hyperband'
```

Let's call `fit` with the Searcher and Scheduler specified above,
and evaluate the resulting model on both validation and test datasets:

```{.python .input}
results = task.fit(dataset,
                   nets,
                   optimizers,
                   lr_scheduler=ag.List('poly', 'cosine'),
                   search_strategy=search_strategy,
                   time_limits=time_limits,
                   epochs=4)
```

The validation and test top-1 accuracy are:

```{.python .input}
print('Top-1 val acc: %.3f' % results.reward)
test_acc = task.evaluate(test_dataset)
print('Top-1 test acc: %.3f' % test_acc)
```


Let's now use the same image as used in :ref:`sec_imgquick` to generate a predicted label and the corresponding confidence.

```{.python .input}
image = '/home/ubuntu/data/test/BabyShirt/BabyShirt_323.jpg'
ind, prob = task.predict(image)
print('The input picture is classified as [%s], with probability %.2f.' %
      (dataset.init().synsets[ind.asscalar()], prob.asscalar()))
```


Beyond what we described here, there are many other aspects of `fit` that an advanced user can control.
For that, please refer to the [fit API](../api/autogluon.task.image_classification.html#autogluon.task.image_classification.ImageClassification.fit).
