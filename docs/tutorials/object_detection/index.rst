Object Detection
====================

For detecting the presence and location of objects in images, AutoGluon provides a simple `fit()` function that automatically produces high quality object detectionÂ models.  A single call to `fit()` will train highly accurate neural networks on your provided image dataset, automatically leveraging accuracy-boosting techniques such as transfer learning and hyperparameter optimization on your behalf.
