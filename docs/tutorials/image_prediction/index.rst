Image Prediction
================

For classifying images based on their content, AutoGluon provides a simple `fit()` function that  automatically produces high quality image classification models.  A single call to `fit()` will train highly accurate neural networks on your provided image dataset, automatically leveraging accuracy-boosting techniques such as transfer learning and hyperparameter optimization on your behalf.
