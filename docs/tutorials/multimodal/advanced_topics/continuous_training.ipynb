    "Continuous training provides a method for machine learning models to refine their performance over time. It enables models to build upon previously acquired knowledge, thereby enhancing accuracy, facilitating knowledge transfer across tasks, and saving computational resources. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate three use cases of continuous training with AutoMM."

    "### Use Case 1: Expanding Training with Additional Data or Training Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the model could benefit from more training epochs or additional training time in case of underfitting. With AutoMM, you can easily extend the training time of your model without starting from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it's also common to need to incorporate more data into your model. AutoMM allows you to continue training with data of the same problem type and same classes if it is a multiclass problem. This flexibility makes it easy to improve and adapt your models as your data grows."

Given a new movie review, the goal is to predict the sentiment reflected in the text (in this case a binary classification, where reviews are labeled as 1 if they convey a positive opinion and labeled as 0 otherwise). Let’s first load and look at the data, noting the labels are stored in a column called label."
