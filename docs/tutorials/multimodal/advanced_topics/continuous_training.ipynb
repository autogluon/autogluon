    "Continuous training provides a method for machine learning models to refine their performance over time. It enables models to build upon previously acquired knowledge, thereby enhancing accuracy, facilitating knowledge transfer across tasks, and saving computational resources. In this tutorial, we will demonstrate three use cases of continuous training with AutoMM."

    "### Use Case 1: Expanding Training with Additional Data or Training Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, the model could benefit from more training epochs or additional training time in case of underfitting. With AutoMM, you can easily extend the training time of your model without starting from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, it's also common to need to incorporate new data into your model. Whether it's more data of the same type, a dataset with a different problem type, or even a dataset with a different set of labels, AutoMM allows you to continue training seamlessly. This flexibility makes it easy to improve and adapt your models as your data grows or evolves."
