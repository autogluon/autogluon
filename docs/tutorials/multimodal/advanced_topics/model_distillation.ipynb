    "Pretrained foundation models are becoming increasingly large. However, these models are difficult to deploy due to \n",
    "limited resources available in deployment scenarios. To benefit from large models under this constraint, \n",
    "you transfer the knowledge from the large-scale teacher models to the student model, with knowledge distillation.\n",
    "In this way, the small student model can be practically deployed under real-world scenarios,\n",
    "while the performance will be better than training the student model from scratch thanks to the teacher.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we introduce how to adopt `MultiModalPredictor` for knowledge distillation. For the purpose of demonstration, we use the [Question-answering NLI](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/qnli) dataset, \n",
    "which comprises 104,743 question, answer pairs sampled from question answering datasets. We will demonstrate how to use a large model to guide the learning and improve the performance of a small model in AutoGluon.\n",

    "sentence pairs in English. In the label column, `0` means that the sentence is not related to the question and `1` means that the sentence is related to the question."
