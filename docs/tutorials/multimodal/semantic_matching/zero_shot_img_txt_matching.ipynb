    "The task of image-text semantic matching refers to measuring the visual-semantic similarity between an image and a sentence. AutoMM supports zero-shot image-text matching by leveraging the powerful [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP). \n",
    "Thanks to the contrastive loss objective and trained on millions of image-text pairs, CLIP learns good embeddings for both vision and language, and their connections. Hence, we can use it to extract embeddings for retrieval and matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "CLIP has a two-tower architecture, which means it has two encoders: one for image, the other for text. An overview of CLIP model can be seen in the diagram below. Left shows its pre-training stage, and Right shows its zero-shot predicton stage. By computing the cosine similarity scores between one image embedding and all the text images, we pick the text which has the highest similarity as the prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the two encoders, we can extract image embeddings, or text embeddings. And most importantly, embedding extraction can be done offline, only similarity computation needs to be done online. So this means good scalability. \n",
    "![CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP/raw/main/CLIP.png)\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will show how the AutoMM's easy-to-use APIs can ship the powerful CLIP to you.\n",
