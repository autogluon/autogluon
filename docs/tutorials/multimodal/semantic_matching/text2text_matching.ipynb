    "Computing the similarity between two sentences/passages is a common task in NLP, with several practical applications such as web search, question answering, documents deduplication, plagiarism comparison, natural language inference, recommendation engines, etc. In general, text similarity models will take two sentences/passages as input and transform them into vectors, and then similarity scores calculated using cosine similarity, dot product, or Euclidean distances are used to measure how alike or different of the two text pieces. \n",

    "## Prepare your Data\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use AutoMM for text-to-text semantic matching with the Stanford Natural Language Inference ([SNLI](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/)) corpus. SNLI is a corpus contains around 570k human-written sentence pairs labeled with *entailment*, *contradiction*, and *neutral*. It is a widely used benchmark for evaluating the representation and inference capbility of machine learning methods. The following table contains three examples taken from this corpus.\n",

    "## Train your Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we want to obtain a model that can return high/low scores for positive/negative text pairs. Traditional text similarity methods only work on a lexical level without taking the semantic aspect into account, for example, using term frequency or tf-idf vectors. With AutoMM, we can easily train a model that captures the semantic relationship between sentences. Basically, it uses [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) to project each sentence into a high-dimensional vector and treat the matching problem as a classification problem following the design in [sentence transformers](https://www.sbert.net/).",
    "\n",
    "With AutoMM, you just need to specify the query, response, and label column names and fit the model on the training dataset without worrying the implementation details. Note that the labels should be binary, and we need to specify the `match_label`, which means two sentences have the same semantic meaning. In practice, your tasks may have different labels, e.g., duplicate or not duplicate. You may need to define the `match_label` by considering your specific task contexts."
