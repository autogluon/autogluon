Multimodal Problems
===================

For problems on multimodal data tables that contain image, text, and tabular data, AutoGluon provides `AutoMMPredictor` that automatically
selects and fuses deep learning backbones from popular packages like [timm](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models),
[huggingface/transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers),
[CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP), etc. You can not only use `AutoMMPredictor` to solve classical text and image prediction
problems such as sentiment classification, intent detection, paraphrase detection, image classification,
but also use it on multimodal problems that involve image, text, and tabular features, e.g., predicting the product price
based on the items' description, photo, and other metadata, or matching images with text descriptions. Moreover, `AutoMMPredictor` can
be used as a basic model in the multi-layer stack-ensemble of `TabularPredictor` (Refer to the tutorial ":ref:`sec_tabularprediction_text_multimodal`"  for more details.)
