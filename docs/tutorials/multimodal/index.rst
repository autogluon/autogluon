Multimodal Prediction
=====================

For problems on multimodal data tables that contain image, text, and tabular data, AutoGluon provides `MultiModalPredictor` (abbreviated as `AutoMM`)
that automatically selects and fuses deep learning backbones from popular packages like `timm <https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models>`_,
`huggingface/transformers <https://github.com/huggingface/transformers>`_,
`CLIP <https://github.com/openai/CLIP>`_, etc. You can use it to build models for multimodal problems that involve image, text, and tabular features, e.g., predicting the product price
based on the items' description, photo, and other metadata, or matching images with text descriptions.

In addition, being good at multimodal problems implies that the predictor will be good for **each specific modality**. Thus, you can also use `AutoMM` to solve standard NLP/Vision tasks like sentiment classification,
intent detection, paraphrase detection, image classification. Moreover, `AutoMM` can be used as a basic model in the multi-layer stack-ensemble of `TabularPredictor`.

In the following, we prepared a few tutorials to help you learn how to use `AutoMM` to solve problems that involve image, text, and tabular data.
