# AutoMM Detection - Evaluate Pretrained Faster R-CNN on COCO Format Dataset
:label:`sec_automm_detection_eval_fasterrcnn_coco`

[COCO](https://cocodataset.org/#home) is a large-scale object detection, segmentation, and captioning dataset. 
This tutorial will walk through the steps of preparing this dataset for Autogluon MultiModalPredictor.

To start, let's import MultiModalPredictor:

```python
from autogluon.multimodal import MultiModalPredictor
```

We select the Faster R-CNN with ResNet50 as backbone and Feature Pyramid Network (FPN) as neck,
this model has **23.9 frames per second (FPS)** on single A10e GPU with `batch_size=1`.
For details about model selection, see :ref:`sec_automm_detection_select_models`.
And we still use all the GPUs (if any):

```python
checkpoint_name = "faster_rcnn_r50_fpn_2x_coco"
num_gpus = -1  # use all GPUs
```

As before, we create the MultiModalPredictor with selected checkpoint name and number of GPUs.
We also need to specify the problem_type to `"object_detection"`.

```python
predictor = MultiModalPredictor(
    hyperparameters={
        "model.mmdet_image.checkpoint_name": checkpoint_name,
        "env.num_gpus": num_gpus,
    },
    problem_type="object_detection",
)
```

Here we use COCO17 for testing. 
See other tutorials for \[Prepare COCO2017], \[Convert VOC Format Dataset to COCO Format], and \[Create Custom Dataset].
While using COCO dataset, the input is the json annotation file of the dataset split.
In this example, `instances_val2017.json` is the annotation file of validation split of COCO17 dataset.

```python
test_path = "coco17/annotations/instances_val2017.json"
```

To evaluate the pretrained Faster R-CNN model we loaded, run:

```python
predictor.evaluate(test_path)
```

And the evaluation results are shown in command line output. The first value `0.385` is mAP in COCO standard, and the second one `0.591` is mAP in VOC standard (or mAP50). For more details about these metrics, see [COCO's evaluation guideline](https://cocodataset.org/#detection-eval).

```
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.385
 Average Precision  (AP) @[ IoU=0.50      | area=   all | maxDets=100 ] = 0.591

 Average Recall     (AR) @[ IoU=0.50:0.95 | area= large | maxDets=100 ] = 0.667

```

Faster R-CNN balances speed and performance. 
But in case that faster speed or higher performance is required, 
see :ref:`sec_automm_detection_eval_yolov3_coco` for faster speed,
or :ref:`sec_automm_detection_eval_ddetr_coco` for higher performance.
You can also see other tutorials for \[Fast Finetune on COCO format data] or \[Inference on COCO format data (with Visualization)].
