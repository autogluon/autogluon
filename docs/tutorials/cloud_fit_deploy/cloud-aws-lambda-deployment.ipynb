    "\n",
    "When the Lambda service receives a request to run a function via the Lambda API, the service first prepares an execution environment. During this step, the service \n",
    "downloads the code for the function, which is stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry. It then creates an environment with the memory, runtime, and configuration \n",
    "specified. Once complete, Lambda runs any initialization code outside of the event handler before finally running the handler code. The steps of setting up the \n",
    "environment and the code are frequently referred to as a \"cold start\".\n",
    "\n",
    "After the execution completes, the execution environment is frozen. To improve resource management and performance, the Lambda service retains the execution environment \n",
    "for a non-deterministic period of time. During this time, if another request arrives for the same function, the service may reuse the environment. This second request \n",
    "typically finishes more quickly, since the execution environment already exists and itâ€™s not necessary to download the code and run the initialization code. \n",
    "This is called a \"warm start\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Because AutoGluon containers are larger than a typical Lambda container, it might take some time (60+ seconds) to perform steps required for a \"cold start\".  \n",
    "This could be limiting factor when used with latency-sensitive applications. To reduce start up times with AWS Lambda it is important to reduce model size to a minimum. \n",
    "This can be done by applying deployment-optimized presets as described in section \"Faster presets or hyperparameters\" of [Predicting Columns in a Table - In Depth](../tabular/tabular-indepth.ipynb):"
