    "### Training other types of predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "The examples are focused on `TabularPredictor`. For training other types of AutoGluon Predictors, i.e. `MultiModalPredictor`, the training script you provide will be similar to the one above. You would need to replace `TabularPredictor` with `MultiModalPredictor`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the container can load the model without external network access (SageMaker containers might have issues getting the models from HuggingFace), the model artifacts of type `MultiModalPredictor` need to be saved with `standalone=True`: `predictor.save(path='MY_PATH', standalone=True)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the specific Predictor type you want to train might not support the same feature sets as `TabularPredictor`. For example, `leaderboard` does not exist for all Predictors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Note on image modality\n",
    "\n",
    "To do inference on image modality, you would need to embed the image info, as bytes for example, into a column of the test data.\n",
    "Then in the inference container, if you are using the `MultiModalPredictor`, you just need to decode the aforementioned image column and feed the test data to it.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def read_image_bytes_and_encode(image_path):\n",
    "    image_obj = open(image_path, 'rb')\n",
    "    image_bytes = image_obj.read()\n",
    "    image_obj.close()\n",
    "    b85_image = base64.b85encode(image_bytes).decode(\"utf-8\")\n",

    "\n",
    "    return dataframe\n",
    "\n",
    "test_data_image_column = \"YOUR_COLUMN_CONTAINING_IMAGE_PATH\"\n",
    "test_data = convert_image_path_to_encoded_bytes_in_dataframe(test_data, test_data_image_column)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To decode the image:\n",

    "test_data[image_column] = [base64.b85decode(bytes) for bytes in test_data[image_column]]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that if you are using the `TabularPredictor`, you would need to save the image to disk and update the test data with the image paths accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to decode the image and save to disk in the inference container:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
