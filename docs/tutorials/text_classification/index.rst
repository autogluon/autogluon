Text classification
===================

For classifying snippets of text (sentences or short paragraphs) based on their content, AutoGluon provides a simple `fit()` function that  automatically produces high quality text classificationÂ models.  A single call to `fit()` will train highly accurate neural networks on your provided text dataset, automatically leveraging accuracy-boosting techniques such as transfer learning and hyperparameter optimization on your behalf.
