    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides an in-depth overview of the time series forecasting capabilities in AutoGluon.\n",
    "Specifically, we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is probabilistic time series forecasting?\n",
    "- Forecasting time series with additional information\n",
    "- What data format is expected by `TimeSeriesPredictor`?\n",
    "- How to evaluate forecast accuracy?\n",
    "- Which forecasting models are available in AutoGluon?\n",
    "- What functionality does `TimeSeriesPredictor` offer?\n",
    "    - Basic configuration with `presets` and `time_limit`\n",
    "    - Manually selecting what models to train\n",
    "    - Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the contents of [Forecasting Time Series - Quick Start](forecasting-quick-start.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is probabilistic time series forecasting?\n",
    "A time series is a sequence of measurements made at regular intervals.\n",
    "The main objective of time series forecasting is to predict the future values of a time series given the past observations.\n",
    "A typical example of this task is demand forecasting.\n",
    "For example, we can represent the number of daily purchases of a certain product as a time series.\n",
    "The goal in this case could be predicting the demand for each of the next 14 days (i.e., the forecast horizon) given the historical purchase data.\n",
    "In AutoGluon, the `prediction_length` argument of the `TimeSeriesPredictor` determines the length of the forecast horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Main goal of forecasting is to predict the future values of a time series given the past observations.](https://autogluon-timeseries-datasets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/figures/forecasting-indepth1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of forecasting could be to predict future values of a given time series, as well as establishing prediction intervals within which the future values will likely lie.\n",
    "In AutoGluon, the `TimeSeriesPredictor` generates two types of forecasts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mean forecast** represents the expected value of the time series at each time step in the forecast horizon.\n",
    "- **quantile forecast** represents the quantiles of the forecast distribution.\n",
    "For example, if the `0.1` quantile (also known as P10, or the 10th percentile) is equal to `x`, it means that the time series value is predicted to be below `x` 10% of the time. As another example, the `0.5` quantile (P50) corresponds to the median forecast.\n",
    "Quantiles can be used to reason about the range of possible outcomes.\n",
    "For instance, by the definition of the quantiles, the time series is predicted to be between the P10 and P90 values with 80% probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mean and quantile (P10 and P90) forecasts.](https://autogluon-timeseries-datasets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/figures/forecasting-indepth2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the `TimeSeriesPredictor` outputs the quantiles `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]`. Custom quantiles can be provided with the `quantile_levels` argument\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictor = TimeSeriesPredictor(quantile_levels=[0.05, 0.5, 0.95])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forecasting time series with additional information\n",
    "In real-world forecasting problems we often have access to additional information, beyond just the raw time series values.\n",
    "AutoGluon supports two types of such additional information: static features and time-varying covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Not all models available in AutoGluon support all types of features & covariates. For an overview, see [Forecasting Model Zoo / Additional features](forecasting-model-zoo.md#additional-features).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static features\n",
    "Static features are the time-independent attributes (metadata) of a time series.\n",
    "These may include information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- location, where the time series was recorded (country, state, city)\n",
    "- fixed properties of a product (brand name, color, size, weight)\n",
    "- store ID or product ID\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing this information may, for instance, help forecasting models generate similar demand forecasts for stores located in the same city.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AutoGluon, static features are stored as an attribute of a `TimeSeriesDataFrame` object.\n",
    "As an example, let's have a look at the M4 Daily dataset."

    "## Which forecasting models are available in AutoGluon?\n",
    "Forecasting models in AutoGluon can be divided into three broad categories: local, global, and ensemble models.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Local models** are simple statistical models that are specifically designed to capture patterns such as trend or seasonality.\n",
    "Despite their simplicity, these models often produce reasonable forecasts and serve as a strong baseline.\n",
    "Some examples of available local models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ETS`\n",
    "- `AutoARIMA`\n",
    "- `Theta`\n",
    "- `SeasonalNaive`\n",
    "\n",
    "If the dataset consists of multiple time series, we fit a separate local model to each time series — hence the name \"local\".\n",
    "This means, if we want to make a forecast for a new time series that wasn't part of the training set, all local models will be fit from scratch for the new time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global models** are machine learning algorithms that learn a single model from the entire training set consisting of multiple time series.\n",
    "Most global models in AutoGluon are provided by the [GluonTS](https://ts.gluon.ai/stable/) library.\n",
    "These are neural-network algorithms implemented in PyTorch, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DeepAR`\n",
    "- `PatchTST`\n",
    "- `DLinear`\n",
    "- `TemporalFusionTransformer`\n",
    "\n",
    "This category also includes pre-trained zero-shot forecasting models like [Chronos](forecasting-chronos.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGluon also offers two tabular global models `RecursiveTabular` and `DirectTabular`.\n",
    "Under the hood, these models convert the forecasting task into a regression problem and fit models like LightGBM from the `autogluon.tabular` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, an **ensemble** model works by combining predictions of all other models.\n",
    "By default, `TimeSeriesPredictor` always fits a `WeightedEnsemble` on top of other models.\n",
    "This can be disabled by setting `enable_ensemble=False` when calling the `fit` method.\n",

    "## What functionality does `TimeSeriesPredictor` offer?\n",
    "AutoGluon offers multiple ways to configure the behavior of a `TimeSeriesPredictor` that are suitable for both beginners and expert users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Basic configuration with `presets` and `time_limit`\n",
    "We can fit `TimeSeriesPredictor` with different pre-defined configurations using the `presets` argument of the `fit` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictor = TimeSeriesPredictor(...)\n",
    "predictor.fit(train_data, presets=\"medium_quality\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher quality presets usually result in better forecasts but take longer to train.\n",
    "The following presets are available:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Preset         | Description                                          | Use Cases                                                                                                                                               | Fit Time (Ideal) |\n",
    "| :------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :--------------- |\n",
    "| `fast_training`  | Fit simple statistical and baseline models + fast tree-based models   | Fast to train but may not be very accurate   |  0.5x |\n",
    "| `medium_quality` | Same models as in `fast_training` + deep learning model `TemporalFusionTransformer` + Chronos-2 (small)           | Good forecasts with reasonable training time         | 1x             |\n",
    "| `high_quality`   | More powerful deep learning, machine learning, statistical and pretrained forecasting models   | Much more accurate than ``medium_quality``, but takes longer to train | 3x |\n",
    "| `best_quality`   | Same models as in `high_quality`, more cross-validation windows | Typically more accurate than `high_quality`, especially for datasets with few (<50) time series | 6x             |\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find more information about the [presets](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/blob/stable/timeseries/src/autogluon/timeseries/configs/presets_configs.py) and the [models includes in each preset](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/blob/stable/timeseries/src/autogluon/timeseries/models/presets.py#L109) in the AutoGluon source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to control the training time is using the `time_limit` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictor.fit(\n",
    "    train_data,\n",
    "    time_limit=60 * 60,  # total training time in seconds\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If no `time_limit` is provided, the predictor will train until all models have been fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manually configuring models\n",
    "Advanced users can override the presets and manually specify what models should be trained by the predictor using the `hyperparameters` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictor = TimeSeriesPredictor(...)\n",
    "\n",
    "predictor.fit(\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    hyperparameters={\n",
    "        \"DeepAR\": {},\n",
    "        \"Theta\": [\n",
    "            {\"decomposition_type\": \"additive\"},\n",
    "            {\"seasonal_period\": 1},\n",
    "        ],\n",
    "    }\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above example will train three models:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ``DeepAR`` with default hyperparameters\n",
    "* ``Theta`` with additive seasonal decomposition (all other parameters set to their defaults)\n",
    "* ``Theta`` with seasonality disabled (all other parameters set to their defaults)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also exclude certain models from the presets using the `excluded_model_type` argument.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictor.fit(\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    presets=\"high_quality\",\n",
    "    excluded_model_types=[\"AutoETS\", \"AutoARIMA\"],\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For the full list of available models and the respective hyperparameters, see [Forecasting Model Zoo](forecasting-model-zoo.md).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Advanced users can define search spaces for model hyperparameters and let AutoGluon automatically determine the best configuration for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from autogluon.common import space\n",
    "\n",
    "predictor = TimeSeriesPredictor()\n",
    "\n",
    "predictor.fit(\n",
    "    train_data,\n",
    "    hyperparameters={\n",
    "        \"DeepAR\": {\n",
    "            \"hidden_size\": space.Int(20, 100),\n",
    "            \"dropout_rate\": space.Categorical(0.1, 0.3),\n",
    "        },\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    hyperparameter_tune_kwargs=\"auto\",\n",
    "    enable_ensemble=False,\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will train multiple versions of the `DeepAR` model with 10 different hyperparameter configurations.\n",
    "AutGluon will automatically select the best model configuration that achieves the highest validation score and use it for prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Currently, HPO is based on Ray Tune for deep learning models from GluonTS, and random search for all other time series models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can change the number of random search trials per model by passing a dictionary as `hyperparameter_tune_kwargs`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictor.fit(\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    hyperparameter_tune_kwargs={\n",
    "        \"num_trials\": 20,\n",
    "        \"scheduler\": \"local\",\n",
    "        \"searcher\": \"random\",\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hyperparameter_tune_kwargs` dict must include the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``\"num_trials\"``: int, number of configurations to train for each tuned model\n",
    "- ``\"searcher\"``: currently, the only supported option is ``\"random\"`` (random search).\n",
    "- ``\"scheduler\"``: currently, the only supported option is ``\"local\"`` (all models trained on the same machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** HPO significantly increases the training time for most models, but often provides only modest performance gains."
