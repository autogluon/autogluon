    "## What is probabilistic time series forecasting?\n",
    "A time series is a sequence of measurements made at regular intervals.\n",
    "The main objective of time series forecasting is to predict the future values of a time series given the past observations.\n",
    "A typical example of this task is demand forecasting.\n",
    "For example, we can represent the number of daily purchases of a certain product as a time series.\n",
    "The goal in this case could be predicting the demand for each of the next 14 days (i.e., the forecast horizon) given the historical purchase data.\n",
    "In AutoGluon, the `prediction_length` argument of the `TimeSeriesPredictor` determines the length of the forecast horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Main goal of forecasting is to predict the future values of a time series given the past observations.](https://autogluon-timeseries-datasets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/figures/forecasting-indepth1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of forecasting could be to predict future averages of a given time series, as well as establishing prediction intervals within which the future values will likely lie.\n",
    "In AutoGluon, the `TimeSeriesPredictor` generates two types of forecasts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mean forecast** represents the expected value of the time series at each time step in the forecast horizon.\n",
    "- **quantile forecast** represents the quantiles of the forecast distribution.\n",
    "For example, if the `0.1` quantile (also known as P10, or the 10th percentile) is equal to `x`, it means that the time series value is predicted to be below `x` 10% of the time. As another example, the `0.5` quantile (P50) corresponds to the median forecast.\n",
    "Quantiles can be used to reason about the range of possible outcomes.\n",
    "For instance, by the definition of the quantiles, the time series is predicted to be between the P10 and P90 values with 80% probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mean and quantile (P10 and P90) forecasts.](https://autogluon-timeseries-datasets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/figures/forecasting-indepth2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the `TimeSeriesPredictor` outputs the quantiles `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]`. Custom quantiles can be provided with the `quantile_levels` argument\n",
    "\n",

    "## Forecasting time series with additional information\n",
    "In real-world forecasting problems we often have access to additional information, beyond just the raw time series values.\n",
    "AutoGluon supports two types of such additional information: static features and time-varying covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static features\n",
    "Static features are the time-independent attributes (metadata) of a time series.\n",
    "These may include information such as:\n",

    "- fixed properties of a product (brand name, color, size, weight)\n",

    "Providing this information may, for instance, help forecasting models generate similar demand forecasts for stores located in the same city.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Which forecasting models are available in AutoGluon?\n",
    "Forecasting models in AutoGluon can be divided into three broad categories: local, global, and ensemble models.\n",

    "Despite their simplicity, these models often produce reasonable forecasts and serve as a strong baseline.\n",

    "- `ARIMA`\n",
    "- `Theta`\n",
    "- `SeasonalNaive`\n",

    "This means, if we want to make a forecast for a new time series that wasn't part of the training set, all local models will be fit from scratch for the new time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global models** are machine learning algorithms that learn a single model from the entire training set consisting of multiple time series.\n",
    "Most global models in AutoGluon are provided by the [GluonTS](https://ts.gluon.ai/stable/) library.\n",
    "These are neural-network algorithms (implemented in PyTorch or MXNet), such as:\n",

    "AutoGluon also offers a tree-based global model `AutoGluonTabular`.\n",
    "Under the hood, this model converts the forecasting task into a regression problem and uses a [TabularPredictor](../../api/_autogen/autogluon.tabular.TabularPredictor.rst) to fit gradient-boosted tree algorithms like XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM.\n",

    "Different evaluation metrics capture different properties of the forecast, and therefore depend on the application that the user has in mind.\n",

    "For more details about the available metrics, see the documentation for [autogluon.timeseries.evaluator.TimeSeriesEvaluator](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/blob/master/timeseries/src/autogluon/timeseries/evaluator.py#L53).\n",

    "Note that AutoGluon always reports all metrics in a **higher-is-better** format.\n",
