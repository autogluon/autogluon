    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial provides an in-depth overview of the time series forecasting capabilities in AutoGluon.\n",
    "Specifically, we will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is probabilistic time series forecasting?\n",
    "- Forecasting time series with additional information\n",
    "- What data format is expected by `TimeSeriesPredictor`?\n",
    "- How to evaluate forecast accuracy?\n",
    "- Which forecasting models are available in AutoGluon?\n",
    "- What functionality does `TimeSeriesPredictor` offer?\n",
    "    - Basic configuration with `presets` and `time_limit`\n",
    "    - Manually selecting what models to train\n",
    "    - Hyperparameter tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the contents of [Forecasting Time Series - Quick Start](forecasting-quick-start.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is probabilistic time series forecasting?\n",
    "A time series is a sequence of measurements made at regular intervals.\n",
    "The main objective of time series forecasting is to predict the future values of a time series given the past observations.\n",
    "A typical example of this task is demand forecasting.\n",
    "For example, we can represent the number of daily purchases of a certain product as a time series.\n",
    "The goal in this case could be predicting the demand for each of the next 14 days (i.e., the forecast horizon) given the historical purchase data.\n",
    "In AutoGluon, the `prediction_length` argument of the `TimeSeriesPredictor` determines the length of the forecast horizon.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Main goal of forecasting is to predict the future values of a time series given the past observations.](https://autogluon-timeseries-datasets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/figures/forecasting-indepth1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of forecasting could be to predict future values of a given time series, as well as establishing prediction intervals within which the future values will likely lie.\n",
    "In AutoGluon, the `TimeSeriesPredictor` generates two types of forecasts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **mean forecast** represents the expected value of the time series at each time step in the forecast horizon.\n",
    "- **quantile forecast** represents the quantiles of the forecast distribution.\n",
    "For example, if the `0.1` quantile (also known as P10, or the 10th percentile) is equal to `x`, it means that the time series value is predicted to be below `x` 10% of the time. As another example, the `0.5` quantile (P50) corresponds to the median forecast.\n",
    "Quantiles can be used to reason about the range of possible outcomes.\n",
    "For instance, by the definition of the quantiles, the time series is predicted to be between the P10 and P90 values with 80% probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Mean and quantile (P10 and P90) forecasts.](https://autogluon-timeseries-datasets.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public/figures/forecasting-indepth2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the `TimeSeriesPredictor` outputs the quantiles `[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]`. Custom quantiles can be provided with the `quantile_levels` argument\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictor = TimeSeriesPredictor(quantile_levels=[0.05, 0.5, 0.95])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Forecasting time series with additional information\n",
    "In real-world forecasting problems we often have access to additional information, beyond just the raw time series values.\n",
    "AutoGluon supports two types of such additional information: static features and time-varying covariates.\n",
    "\n",
    "```{note}\n",
    "Not all models available in AutoGluon support all types of features & covariates. For an overview, see [Forecasting Model Zoo / Additional features](forecasting-model-zoo.md#additional-features).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Static features\n",
    "Static features are the time-independent attributes (metadata) of a time series.\n",
    "These may include information such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- location, where the time series was recorded (country, state, city)\n",
    "- fixed properties of a product (brand name, color, size, weight)\n",
    "- store ID or product ID\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing this information may, for instance, help forecasting models generate similar demand forecasts for stores located in the same city.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AutoGluon, static features are stored as an attribute of a `TimeSeriesDataFrame` object.\n",
    "As an example, let's have a look at the M4 Daily dataset."

    "Despite their simplicity, these models often produce reasonable forecasts and serve as a strong baseline.\n",
    "Some examples of available local models:\n",
    "\n",

    "- `AutoARIMA`\n",
    "- `Theta`\n",
    "- `SeasonalNaive`\n",

    "This means, if we want to make a forecast for a new time series that wasn't part of the training set, all local models will be fit from scratch for the new time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Global models** are machine learning algorithms that learn a single model from the entire training set consisting of multiple time series.\n",
    "Most global models in AutoGluon are provided by the [GluonTS](https://ts.gluon.ai/stable/) library.\n",
    "These are neural-network algorithms implemented in PyTorch, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `DeepAR`\n",
    "- `PatchTST`\n",
    "- `DLinear`\n",
    "- `TemporalFusionTransformer`\n",
    "\n",
    "This category also includes pre-trained zero-shot forecasting models like [Chronos](forecasting-chronos.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGluon also offers two tabular global models `RecursiveTabular` and `DirectTabular`.\n",
    "Under the hood, these models convert the forecasting task into a regression problem and fit models like LightGBM from the `autogluon.tabular` module.\n",

    "Currently, HPO is based on Ray Tune for deep learning models from GluonTS, and random search for all other time series models.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can change the number of random search trials per model by passing a dictionary as `hyperparameter_tune_kwargs`\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "predictor.fit(\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "    hyperparameter_tune_kwargs={\n",
    "        \"num_trials\": 20,\n",
    "        \"scheduler\": \"local\",\n",
    "        \"searcher\": \"random\",\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    ...\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `hyperparameter_tune_kwargs` dict must include the following keys:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ``\"num_trials\"``: int, number of configurations to train for each tuned model\n",
    "- ``\"searcher\"``: currently, the only supported option is ``\"random\"`` (random search).\n",
    "- ``\"scheduler\"``: currently, the only supported option is ``\"local\"`` (all models trained on the same machine)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** HPO significantly increases the training time for most models, but often provides only modest performance gains."
