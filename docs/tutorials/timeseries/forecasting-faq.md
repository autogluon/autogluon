# AutoGluon Time Series FAQ

## What forecasting tasks can AutoGluon be used for?
AutoGluon can generate **probabilistic** multi-step-ahead forecasts for one or multiple **univariate** time series.
For example, you can use AutoGluon to forecast daily sales of multiple products over the next month.

AutoGluon also supports additional information, such as time-independent static features (e.g., location of the store)
and time-dependent covariates (e.g., price of the product each day).
See the [In Depth Tutorial](forecasting-indepth.ipynb) for more details.

Currently, AutoGluon does not support features such as hierarchical forecasting and forecast explainability.

## How can I get the most accurate forecasts?
To maximize the forecast accuracy, set the `predictor.fit()` argument `presets="best_quality"` and provide a high `time_limit`.

## How should I choose the evaluation metric?
See [Evaluation Metrics](forecasting-metrics.md)

## Are there any restrictions on the data that I can pass to TimeSeriesPredictor?
See ["What data format is expected by `TimeSeriesPredictor`?" in the In Depth Tutorial](forecasting-indepth.ipynb)


## Can I use GPUs for model training?

Yes! All deep learning models used by `autogluon.timeseries` support GPU training.
The models will be automatically trained on a GPU if (1) your machine has a GPU and (2) you installed a PyTorch version with CUDA support.
Multi-GPU training is not yet supported.


## What machine is best for running AutoGluon TimeSeries?
AutoGluon can be run on any machine including your laptop.
It is not necessary to use a GPU to train `TimeSeriesPredictor`, so CPU machines are fine.
Using a machine with more CPU cores and more RAM will lead to faster training and allow you to quickly generate forecasts for larger datasets.
For example if using AWS instances: we recommend [M6 instances](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/m6i/) instances, where a `m6i.24xlarge` machine should be able to handle most datasets.


## Issues not addressed here
First search if your issue is addressed in the [tutorials](index.md),
[documentation](../../api/autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.rst), or [Github issues](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/issues)
(search both Closed and Open issues).
If it is not there, please open a [new Github Issue](https://github.com/autogluon/autogluon/issues/new) and
clearly state your issue and clarify how it relates to the module.

If you have a bug, please include: your code (ideally set `verbosity=4` which will print out more details), the
output printed during the code execution, and information about your operating system, Python version, and
installed packages (output of `pip freeze`).
Many user issues stem from incorrectly formatted data, so please describe your data as clearly as possible.
