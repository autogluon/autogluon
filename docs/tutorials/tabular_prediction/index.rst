Tabular Prediction
====================

For standard datasets that are represented as tables (stored as CSV file, parquet from database, etc.), AutoGluon can produce models to predict the values in one column based on the values in the other columns. With just a single call to `fit()`, you can achieve high accuracy in standard supervised learning tasks (both classification and regression), without dealing with cumbersome issues like data cleaning, feature engineering, hyperparameter optimization, model selection, etc.
