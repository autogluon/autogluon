# Interpretable rule-based modeling
:label:`sec_tabularinterpretability`

**Tip**: Prior to reading this tutorial, it is recommended to have a basic understanding of the TabularPredictor API covered in :ref:`sec_tabularquick`.

In this tutorial, we will explain how to automatically use interpretable models powered by integration with [üîç the imodels package](https://github.com/csinva/imodels). This allows for automatically learning models based on rules which are extremely concise and can be useful for (1) understanding data or (2) building a transparent predictive model.
