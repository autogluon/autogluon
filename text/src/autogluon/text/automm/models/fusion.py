        ----------
        prefix
            The fusion model's prefix
        models
            The individual models whose output features will be fused.
        hidden_features
            A list of integers representing the hidden feature dimensions. For example,
            [512, 128, 64] indicates three hidden MLP layers with their corresponding output
            feature dimensions.
        num_classes
            The number of classes.
        adapt_in_features
            Choice of how to adapt the features of each model. We now support
            - min
                Adapt all features to the minimum dimension. For example, if three models have
                feature dimensions [512, 768, 64], it will linearly map all the features to
                dimension 64.
            - max
                Adapt all features to the maximum dimension. For example, if three models have
                feature dimensions are [512, 768, 64], it will linearly map all the features to
                dimension 768.
        activation
            Name of activation function.
        dropout_prob
            Dropout probability.
        normalization
            Name of normalization function.
        loss_weight
            The weight of individual models. For example, if we fuse the features of ViT, CLIP, and BERT,
            The loss will be computed as "loss = fusion_loss + loss_weight(vit_loss + clip_loss + bert_loss)".
