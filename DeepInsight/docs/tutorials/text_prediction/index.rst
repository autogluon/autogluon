Text Prediction
===============

For supervised learning with text data, AutoGluon provides a simple `fit()` function that automatically
produces high quality text prediction models (Transformer neural networks). Each training example may be a sentence, a short paragraph, comprised of multiple text fields (e.g. predicting how similar two sentences are), or may even contain additional numeric/categorical features beyond just text. The target values (labels) to predict may be continuous values (regression) or discrete categories (classification).
A single call to `predictor.fit()` will train highly accurate neural networks on your provided text dataset, automatically leveraging accuracy-boosting techniques such as fine-tuning a pretrained NLP  model (transfer learning) and hyperparameter optimization.
