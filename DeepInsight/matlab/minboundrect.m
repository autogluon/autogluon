function [rectx,recty,area,perimeter] = minboundrect(x,y,metric)
% minboundrect: Compute the minimal bounding rectangle of points in the plane
% usage: [rectx,recty,area,perimeter] = minboundrect(x,y,metric)
%
% arguments: (input)
%  x,y - vectors of points, describing points in the plane as
%        (x,y) pairs. x and y must be the same lengths.
%
%  metric - (OPTIONAL) - single letter character flag which
%        denotes the use of minimal area or perimeter as the
%        metric to be minimized. metric may be either 'a' or 'p',
%        capitalization is ignored. Any other contraction of 'area'
%        or 'perimeter' is also accepted.
%
%        DEFAULT: 'a'    ('area')
%
% arguments: (output)
%  rectx,recty - 5x1 vectors of points that define the minimal
%        bounding rectangle.
%
%  area - (scalar) area of the minimal rect itself.
%
%  perimeter - (scalar) perimeter of the minimal rect as found
%
%
% Note: For those individuals who would prefer the rect with minimum
% perimeter or area, careful testing convinces me that the minimum area
% rect was generally also the minimum perimeter rect on most problems
% (with one class of exceptions). This same testing appeared to verify my
% assumption that the minimum area rect must always contain at least
% one edge of the convex hull. The exception I refer to above is for
% problems when the convex hull is composed of only a few points,
% most likely exactly 3. Here one may see differences between the
% two metrics. My thanks to Roger Stafford for pointing out this
% class of counter-examples.
%
% Thanks are also due to Roger for pointing out a proof that the
% bounding rect must always contain an edge of the convex hull, in
% both the minimal perimeter and area cases.
