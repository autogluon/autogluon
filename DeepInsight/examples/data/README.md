A subset of the TCGA [RNAseq FPKM UQ](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Encyclopedia/pages/HTSeq-FPKM-UQ/) data from the 
original manuscipt. The example data was generated from a random selection of 200 samples from each of the cancer types
BRCA, KIRC, and COAD (total 600 samples). Then the 5,000 genes with the largest standard variation were selected.
