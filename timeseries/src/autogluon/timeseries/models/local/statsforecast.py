    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    model : {"Z", "N", "S", "P", "F"}, default = "Z"
        Defines type of CES model, "N" for simple CES, "S" for simple seasonality, "P" for partial seasonality
        (without complex part), "F" for full seasonality. When "Z" is selected, the best model is selected using
        Akaike Information Criterion (AIC).
    seasonal_period : int or None, default = None
        Number of time steps in a complete seasonal cycle for seasonal models. For example, 7 for daily data with a
        weekly cycle or 12 for monthly data with an annual cycle.
        When set to None, seasonal_period will be inferred from the frequency of the training data. Can also be
        specified manually by providing an integer > 1.
        If seasonal_period (inferred or provided) is equal to 1, seasonality will be disabled.
    n_jobs : int or float, default = 0.5
        Number of CPU cores used to fit the models in parallel.
        When set to a float between 0.0 and 1.0, that fraction of available CPU cores is used.
        When set to a positive integer, that many cores are used.
        When set to -1, all CPU cores are used.
    max_ts_length : int, default = 2500
        If not None, only the last ``max_ts_length`` time steps of each time series will be used to train the model.
        This significantly speeds up fitting and usually leads to no change in accuracy.
