    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    seasonal_period : int or None, default = None
        Number of time steps in a complete seasonal cycle for seasonal models. For example, 7 for daily data with a
        weekly cycle or 12 for monthly data with an annual cycle.
        When set to None, seasonal_period will be inferred from the frequency of the training data. Can also be
        specified manually by providing an integer > 1.
        If seasonal_period (inferred or provided) is equal to 1, will fall back to Naive forecast.
        Seasonality will also be disabled, if the length of the time series is < seasonal_period.
