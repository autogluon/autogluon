class TimeSeriesPredictor:
    """AutoGluon ``TimeSeriesPredictor`` predicts future values of multiple related time series.

    ``TimeSeriesPredictor`` provides probabilistic (quantile) multi-step-ahead forecasts for univariate time series.
    The forecast includes both the mean (i.e., conditional expectation of future values given the past), as well as the
    quantiles of the forecast distribution, indicating the range of possible future outcomes.

    ``TimeSeriesPredictor`` fits both "global" deep learning models that are shared across all time series
    (e.g., DeepAR, Transformer), as well as "local" statistical models that are fit to each individual time series
    (e.g., ARIMA, ETS).

    ``TimeSeriesPredictor`` expects input data and makes predictions in the
    :class:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesDataFrame` format.


    Parameters
    ----------
    target : str, default = "target"
        Name of column that contains the target values to forecast (i.e., numeric observations of the time series).
    prediction_length : int, default = 1
        The forecast horizon, i.e., How many time steps into the future the models should be trained to predict.
        For example, if time series contain daily observations, setting ``prediction_length = 3`` will train
        models that predict up to 3 days into the future from the most recent observation.
    freq : str, optional
        Frequency of the time series data (see `pandas documentation <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/timeseries.html#offset-aliases>`_
        for available frequencies). For example, ``"D"`` for daily data or ``"H"`` for hourly data.

        By default, the predictor will attempt to automatically infer the frequency from the data. This argument should
        only be set in two cases:

        1. The time series data has irregular timestamps, so frequency cannot be inferred automatically.
        2. You would like to resample the original data at a different frequency (for example, convert hourly measurements into daily measurements).

        If ``freq`` is provided when creating the predictor, all data passed to the predictor will be automatically
        resampled at this frequency.
    eval_metric : Union[str, TimeSeriesScorer], default = "WQL"
        Metric by which predictions will be ultimately evaluated on future test data. AutoGluon tunes hyperparameters
        in order to improve this metric on validation data, and ranks models (on validation data) according to this
        metric.

        Probabilistic forecast metrics (evaluated on quantile forecasts for the specified ``quantile_levels``):

        - ``"WQL"``: mean weighted quantile loss, defined as average of quantile losses divided by the sum of absolute time series values in the forecast horizon.
        - ``"SQL"``: scaled quantile loss, defined as average of quantile losses divided by the in-sample seasonal error.

        Point forecast metrics (these are always evaluated on the ``"mean"`` column of the predictions):

        - ``"MAPE"``: mean absolute percentage error
        - ``"sMAPE"``: "symmetric" mean absolute percentage error
        - ``"MASE"``: mean absolute scaled error
        - ``"MSE"``: mean squared error
        - ``"RMSE"``: root mean squared error
        - ``"WAPE"``: weighted absolute percentage error
        - ``"RMSSE"``: Root Mean Squared Scaled Error . See https://otexts.com/fpp3/accuracy.html#scaled-errors

        For more information about these metrics, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/forecast/latest/dg/metrics.html.
    eval_metric_seasonal_period : int, optional
        Seasonal period used to compute some evaluation metrics such as mean absolute scaled error (MASE). Defaults to
        ``None``, in which case the seasonal period is computed based on the data frequency.
    known_covariates_names: List[str], optional
        Names of the covariates that are known in advance for all time steps in the forecast horizon. These are also
        known as dynamic features, exogenous variables, additional regressors or related time series. Examples of such
        covariates include holidays, promotions or weather forecasts.

        Currently, only numeric (float of integer dtype) are supported.

        If ``known_covariates_names`` are provided, then:

        - :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.fit`, :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.evaluate`, and :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.leaderboard` will expect a data frame with columns listed in ``known_covariates_names`` (in addition to the ``target`` column).
        - :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.predict` will expect an additional keyword argument ``known_covariates`` containing the future values of the known covariates in ``TimeSeriesDataFrame`` format.

    quantile_levels : List[float], optional
        List of increasing decimals that specifies which quantiles should be estimated when making distributional
        forecasts. Defaults to ``[0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9]``.
    path : str, optional
        Path to the directory where models and intermediate outputs will be saved. Defaults to a timestamped folder
        ``AutogluonModels/ag-[TIMESTAMP]`` that will be created in the working directory.
    verbosity : int, default = 2
        Verbosity levels range from 0 to 4 and control how much information is printed to stdout. Higher levels
        correspond to more detailed print statements, and ``verbosity=0`` suppresses output including warnings.
        If using ``logging``, you can alternatively control amount of information printed via ``logger.setLevel(L)``,
        where ``L`` ranges from 0 to 50 (Note: higher values of ``L`` correspond to fewer print statements, opposite
        of verbosity levels).
    cache_predictions : bool, default = True
        If True, the predictor will cache and reuse the predictions made by individual models whenever
        :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.predict`, :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.leaderboard`,
        or :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.evaluate` methods are called. This allows to significantly
        speed up these methods. If False, caching will be disabled. You can set this argument to False to reduce disk
        usage at the cost of longer prediction times.
    label : str, optional
        Alias for :attr:`target`.

        Parameters
        ----------
        train_data : Union[TimeSeriesDataFrame, pd.DataFrame, str]
            Training data in the :class:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesDataFrame` format.

            Time series with length ``<= (num_val_windows + 1) * prediction_length`` will be ignored during training.
            See :attr:`num_val_windows` for details.

            If ``known_covariates_names`` were specified when creating the predictor, ``train_data`` must include the
            columns listed in ``known_covariates_names`` with the covariates values aligned with the target time series.
            The known covariates must have a numeric (float or integer) dtype.

            Columns of ``train_data`` except ``target`` and those listed in ``known_covariates_names`` will be
            interpreted as ``past_covariates`` - covariates that are known only in the past.

            If ``train_data`` has static features (i.e., ``train_data.static_features`` is a pandas DataFrame), the
            predictor will interpret columns with ``int`` and ``float`` dtypes as continuous (real-valued) features,
            columns with ``object`` and ``str`` dtypes as categorical features, and will ignore the rest of columns.

            For example, to ensure that column "store_id" with dtype ``int`` is interpreted as a category,
            we need to change its type to ``category``::

                data.static_features["store_id"] = data.static_features["store_id"].astype("category")

            If provided data is an instance of pandas DataFrame, AutoGluon will attempt to automatically convert it
            to a ``TimeSeriesDataFrame``.

        tuning_data : Union[TimeSeriesDataFrame, pd.DataFrame, str], optional
            Data reserved for model selection and hyperparameter tuning, rather than training individual models. Also
            used to compute the validation scores. Note that only the last ``prediction_length`` time steps of each
            time series are used for computing the validation score.

            If ``tuning_data`` is provided, multi-window backtesting on training data will be disabled, the
            :attr:`num_val_windows` will be set to ``0``, and :attr:`refit_full` will be set to ``False``.

            Leaving this argument empty and letting AutoGluon automatically generate the validation set from
            ``train_data`` is a good default.

            If ``known_covariates_names`` were specified when creating the predictor, ``tuning_data`` must also include
            the columns listed in ``known_covariates_names`` with the covariates values aligned with the target time
            series.

            If ``train_data`` has past covariates or static features, ``tuning_data`` must have also include them (with
            same columns names and dtypes).

            If provided data is an instance of pandas DataFrame, AutoGluon will attempt to automatically convert it
            to a ``TimeSeriesDataFrame``.

        time_limit : int, optional
            Approximately how long :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.fit` will run (wall-clock time in
            seconds). If not specified, :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.fit` will run until all models
            have completed training.
        presets : str, optional
            Optional preset configurations for various arguments in
            :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.fit`.

            Can significantly impact predictive accuracy, memory footprint, inference latency of trained models,
            and various other properties of the returned predictor. It is recommended to specify presets and avoid
            specifying most other :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.fit` arguments or model
            hyperparameters prior to becoming familiar with AutoGluon. For example, set ``presets="high_quality"``
            to get a high-accuracy predictor, or set ``presets="fast_training"`` to quickly fit multiple simple
            statistical models.
            Any user-specified arguments in :meth:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor.fit` will
            override the values used by presets.

            Available presets:

            - ``"fast_training"``: fit simple statistical models (``ETS``, ``Theta``, ``Naive``, ``SeasonalNaive``) + fast tree-based model ``RecursiveTabular``. These models are fast to train but may not be very accurate.
            - ``"medium_quality"``: all models mentioned above + deep learning model ``DeepAR``. Default setting that produces good forecasts with reasonable training time.
            - ``"high_quality"``: all models mentioned above + automatically tuned statistical models (``AutoETS``, ``AutoARIMA``) + tree-based model ``DirectTabular`` + deep learning models ``TemporalFusionTransformer`` and ``PatchTST`` . Much more accurate than ``medium_quality``, but takes longer to train.
            - ``"best_quality"``: all models mentioned above + more tabular models + training multiple copies of ``DeepAR``. Usually better than ``high_quality``, but takes even longer to train.

            Details for these presets can be found in ``autogluon/timeseries/configs/presets_configs.py``. If not
            provided, user-provided values for ``hyperparameters`` and ``hyperparameter_tune_kwargs`` will be used
            (defaulting to their default values specified below).
        hyperparameters : str or dict, default = "medium_quality"
            Determines what models are trained and what hyperparameters are used by each model.

            If str is passed, will use a preset hyperparameter configuration defined in`
            `autogluon/timeseries/trainer/models/presets.py``.

            If dict is provided, the keys are strings or types that indicate which models to train. Each value is
            itself a dict containing hyperparameters for each of the trained models, or a list of such dicts. Any
            omitted hyperparameters not specified here will be set to default. For example::

                predictor.fit(
                    ...
                    hyperparameters={
                        "DeepAR": {},
                        "ETS": [
                            {"seasonal": "add"},
                            {"seasonal": None},
                        ],
                    }
                )

            The above example will train three models:

            * ``DeepAR`` with default hyperparameters
            * ``ETS`` with additive seasonality (all other parameters set to their defaults)
            * ``ETS`` with seasonality disabled (all other parameters set to their defaults)

            Full list of available models and their hyperparameters is provided in :ref:`forecasting_zoo`.

            The hyperparameters for each model can be fixed values (as shown above), or search spaces over which
            hyperparameter optimization is performed. A search space should only be provided when
            ``hyperparameter_tune_kwargs`` is given (i.e., hyperparameter-tuning is utilized). For example::

                from autogluon.common import space

                predictor.fit(
                    ...
                    hyperparameters={
                        "DeepAR": {
                            "hidden_size": space.Int(20, 100),
                            "dropout_rate": space.Categorical(0.1, 0.3),
                        },
                    },
                    hyperparameter_tune_kwargs="auto",
                )

            In the above example, multiple versions of the DeepAR model with different values of the parameters
            "hidden_size" and "dropout_rate" will be trained.
        hyperparameter_tune_kwargs : str or dict, optional
            Hyperparameter tuning strategy and kwargs (for example, how many HPO trials to run). If ``None``, then
            hyperparameter tuning will not be performed.

            Currently, only HPO based on random search is supported for time series models.

            Setting this parameter to string ``"random"`` performs 10 trials of random search per model.

            We can change the number of random search trials per model by passing a dictionary as `hyperparameter_tune_kwargs`.
            The dict must include the following keys

            - ``"num_trials"``: int, number of configurations to train for each tuned model
            - ``"searcher"``: currently, the only supported option is ``"random"`` (random search)
            - ``"scheduler"``: currently, the only supported option is ``"local"`` (all models trained on the same machine)

            Example::

                predictor.fit(
                    ...
                    hyperparameter_tune_kwargs={
                        "num_trials": 5,
                        "searcher": "random",
                        "scheduler": "local",
                    },
                )
        excluded_model_types: List[str], optional
            Banned subset of model types to avoid training during ``fit()``, even if present in ``hyperparameters``.
            For example, the following code will train all models included in the ``high_quality`` presets except ``DeepAR``::

                predictor.fit(
                    ...,
                    presets="high_quality",
                    excluded_model_types=["DeepAR"],
                )
        num_val_windows : int or None, default = 1
            Number of backtests done on ``train_data`` for each trained model to estimate the validation performance.
            If ``num_val_windows=None``, the predictor will attempt to set this parameter automatically based on the
            length of time series in ``train_data`` (at most to 5).

            Increasing this parameter increases the training time roughly by a factor of ``num_val_windows // refit_every_n_windows``.
            See :attr:`refit_every_n_windows` and :attr:`val_step_size`: for details.

            For example, for ``prediction_length=2``, ``num_val_windows=3`` and ``val_step_size=1`` the folds are::

                |-------------------|
                | x x x x x y y - - |
                | x x x x x x y y - |
                | x x x x x x x y y |

            where ``x`` are the train time steps and ``y`` are the validation time steps.

            This argument has no effect if ``tuning_data`` is provided.
        val_step_size : int or None, default = None
            Step size between consecutive validation windows. If set to ``None``, defaults to ``prediction_length``
            provided when creating the predictor.

            This argument has no effect if ``tuning_data`` is provided.
        refit_every_n_windows: int or None, default = 1
            When performing cross validation, each model will be retrained every ``refit_every_n_windows`` validation
            windows. If set to ``None``, model will only be fit once for the first validation window.
        refit_full : bool, default = False
            If True, after training is complete, AutoGluon will attempt to re-train all models using all of training
            data (including the data initially reserved for validation). This argument has no effect if ``tuning_data``
            is provided.
        enable_ensemble : bool, default = True
            If True, the ``TimeSeriesPredictor`` will fit a simple weighted ensemble on top of the models specified via
            ``hyperparameters``.
        random_seed : int, optional
            If provided, fixes the seed of the random number generator for all models. This guarantees reproducible
            results for most models (except those trained on GPU because of the non-determinism of GPU operations).
        verbosity : int, optional
            If provided, overrides the ``verbosity`` value used when creating the ``TimeSeriesPredictor``. See
            documentation for :class:`~autogluon.timeseries.TimeSeriesPredictor` for more details.

            Time series data to forecast with.

            If ``known_covariates_names`` were specified when creating the predictor, ``data`` must include the columns
            listed in ``known_covariates_names`` with the covariates values aligned with the target time series.

        known_covariates : Union[TimeSeriesDataFrame, pd.DataFrame, str], optional
            If ``known_covariates_names`` were specified when creating the predictor, it is necessary to provide the
            values of the known covariates for each time series during the forecast horizon. That is:

            - The columns must include all columns listed in ``known_covariates_names``
            - The ``item_id`` index must include all item ids present in ``data``
            - The ``timestamp`` index must include the values for ``prediction_length`` many time steps into the future from the end of each time series in ``data``

            See example below.
        model : str, optional
            Name of the model that you would like to use for prediction. By default, the best model during training
            (with highest validation score) will be used.
        random_seed : int or None, default = 123
            If provided, fixes the seed of the random number generator for all models. This guarantees reproducible
            results for most models (except those trained on GPU because of the non-determinism of GPU operations).
        use_cache : bool, default = True
            If True, will attempt to use the cached predictions. If False, cached predictions will be ignored.

        Parameters
        ----------
        data : Union[TimeSeriesDataFrame, pd.DataFrame, str]
            The data to evaluate the best model on. The last ``prediction_length`` time steps of the data set, for each
            item, will be held out for prediction and forecast accuracy will be calculated on these time steps.

            If ``known_covariates_names`` were specified when creating the predictor, ``data`` must include the columns
            listed in ``known_covariates_names`` with the covariates values aligned with the target time series.

            Evaluation metric to compute scores with. Defaults to ``self.eval_metric``
        use_cache : bool, default = True

            A forecast accuracy score, where higher values indicate better quality. For consistency, error metrics
