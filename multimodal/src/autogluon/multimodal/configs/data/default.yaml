  label:
    numerical_label_preprocessing: "standardscaler"  # The mode of label preprocessing for . Support "standardscaler" or "minmaxscaler" or "none" / None (means no transform).

  column_features_pooling_mode: "concat"  # How to pool multi-column features into one feature vector. Currently only support "concat" or "mean" for few shot classification.
