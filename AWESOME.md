## AutoML Benchmarks using AutoGluon
* [AMLB: An AutoML Benchmark](https://openml.github.io/automlbenchmark/)
  * For a thorough comparison of AutoGluon and other modern AutoML systems, please refer to the 2022 paper ["AMLB: An AutoML Benchmark"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.12560) where AutoGluon is shown to be the state-of-the-art among AutoML systems on tabular data.
  * We encourage all users to benchmark AutoGluon & other AutoML frameworks on AMLB.
  * This is our preferred benchmark as it is widely accepted and trusted within the AutoML community.

## Papers using AutoGluon
